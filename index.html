			Everyone I love ends up at Rehoboth beach. <br>
			Everyone I bring to Rehoboth beach leaves me. <br>
			Their ghosts are with me, <br>
			here, now as I drive across the Bay Bridge. <br>
			I remember what they all said, <br>
			as we approached the monumental arch on the horizon, <br>
			and I asked them if they were afraid of heights. <br>
			I hear you saying it now <br>
			all of you <br>
			all my gone loves <br>
			all in a cacophony <br>
			riding on my back <br>

			forever in my eye. <br>
			I blink and tear <br>
			but I can’t be rid of you. <br>
			 <br>
			A ghost without a home, <br>
			a ghost outside of soil is a burden, <br>
			so I’ll set you to rest. <br>
			I’ll bury you here, <br>
			on this dark gray beach <br>
			on a rainy day <br>
			in November. <br>
			I’ll put you under damp sand <br>
			packed down, <br>
			in a mass grave, <br>

			Stay here now, <br>

			But I never come alone <br>
			and each of you I bring, <br>
			finds the same fate. <br>
			 <br>
			Maybe one year I won’t make it back. <br>
			Maybe someday the beach front this town dredges back to life every year will wash away <br>
			and the tide will tear through town, <br>

			Caustic yellow <br>
			like gasoline on the surface of the pond. <br>
			Color like the hood of a spitting snake, <br>

			He’s so like me, I feel myself magnetized to his mind. <br>
			 <br>
			He’s so cold now, <br>
			we don’t talk now. <br>
			I visit in the winter, I don’t know why I still come here. <br>
			A father like winter, dead-frosted tired <br>
			unbiased in uniform stoic gaze. <br>
			 <br>
			Polarity drove my mother away, <br>
			my beach mother, mother like Summer. <br>
			An undying sun, burning me. <br>
			The heat seems unnatural to me, <br>
			She brings people joy, <br>
			I don’t understand those people, <br>
			I don’t understand her. <br>
			 <br>
			They’re different by design. <br>
			I wonder if they weren't always this way, <br>
			If people become their solstice over time. <br>
			 <br>
			I’m falling, <br>
			&nbsp&nbspsometimes I feel my fate <br>
			in the cold limp freeze, <br>
			&nbsp&nbspall color drained to pale blue. <br>
			until then I’m firey, <br>
			until then, breathe me in <br>
			I’m here with you. <br>

			Look now <br>
			Taking the match in my hand <br>
			I tap it downwards against the strike pad <br>
			galloping flame opens <br>
			Some matches burn straight, <br>
			Other matches burn in layers. <br>
			If you hold a match vertically it'll drown <br>
			So let the flame creep up the sideways wood <br>
			And begin to melt your fingers, <br>
			It turns into a mountain shape <br>
			And blinks in the wind. <br>
			When it dies its spirit lingers in the black body, <br>
			It still burns inside, <br>
			but you can see it leave <br>
			as a last breath of smoke. <br>
			 <br>
			Books though <br>
			Books burn thick. <br>
			If you open one up and drop a match on the spine <br>
			The book bloats and won't close <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - All the pages turn black and wrinkle into brittle sheets. <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When you slam it closed it keeps burning on the inside <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp And ash plumes out the top. <br>
			 <br>
			I burn matches <br>
			I breathe smoke <br>
			From cigarettes <br>
			To make a moment stick around <br>
			On my fingers and lips <br>
			Until the next morning <br>
			When I wake up and smell it again <br>
			And know I wasn't faking. <br>
			 <br>
			And when it's night <br>
			And there are no cars driving <br>
			I sit on the street and close my eyes. <br>
			It's passive danger <br>
			I could die <br>
			But probably I won't <br>
			And I haven't yet <br>
			So I keep going <br>
			I like to have my fate <br>
			Out of my hands <br>
			 <br>
			Let the match drop into the dark <br>
			We're all sleeping soundly now <br>
			Dreams sit on top of the water <br>
			They undulate like waves <br>
			They are tumbling <br>
			Down in a hole <br>
			Snaking like smoke on air <br>
			Suspension in a fluid <br>
			Drifting like snow on breezes <br>
			Grouped and curling <br>
			At the bottom of a <br>
			well <br>
			 <br>
			The depths of the darkness around me can only be measured by the distance between my brain and the backs of my eyelids <br>
			To Light A Match <br>
			Illuminates my hands and face <br>
			But it only scratches at the darkness. <br>
			 <br>
			Somewhere deep <br>
			We all want to live forever. <br>
			This is where religion should dive in to save me. <br>
			Deeply forsaken, <br>
			I'm lost in a bog <br>
			I can't move my legs below the knee. <br>
			Cut off my arms and paint me grey <br>
			I am beautiful in this field of red and black <br>

		<p class="poemTitle">The only thing in Berryville, Virginia is the Train</p>
		<p class="poem">
			The rails whistle if you put your ear to them <br>
			At 3:00 o’clock on Friday nights. <br>
			We would stay to see it come and stop <br>
			Lying across the tracks <br>
			Tossing empty bottles. <br>
			I'd picture myself being severed into three pieces <br>
			across the rails. <br>
			 <br>
			There are two sets of parallel tracks in the small town. <br>
			A train slows and stops every time <br>
			And we climb on in the clear winter moon. <br>
			The freight of steel containers <br>
			And the whole shape <br>
			frozen cold. <br>
			We wait and watch other trains go by <br>
			inches away <br>
			Hauling coal from West Virginia on the twin rail <br>
			We swing our legs <br>
			We talk about growing older. <br>
			 <br>
			When the train begins to crawl again <br>
			it starts a series of gunshots <br>
			clasping hands all along the resting chain. <br>
			We stay on the train as it begins to move. <br>
			The cold speeding air asks me to ride the train somewhere else. <br>
			Through the wild buffeting I hear screaming. <br>
			When I jump off, <br>
			Into the crunch of rocks, <br>
			it's all silent, besides the <br>
			clockwork thunk of the train moving on. <br>
			 <br>
			I like to lay between a pair of tracks <br>
			With my hands crossed like a coffin <br>
			And imagine a train avalanching over me. <br>
			 <br>
			We would lie in the streets <br>
			And die together <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp so slowly. <br>
			Some of us did die there, <br>
			The rest are cursed to remember, <br>
			To be authors and artists <br>
			Because we've been graced with the unique small town experience. <br>
			We would sit in the rain <br>
			And die. <br>
			 <br>
			This plague town <br>
			The ground is falling out <br>
			And the bedrooms are filling <br>
			From the ceiling to the floor with <br>
			Thick dripping darkness. <br>
			Some people know how they'll die. <br>
			I'll die from silence. <br>
			Dark breeding asphyxiation. <br>
			 <br>
			I don't have the moral authority <br>
			To convince myself that I'm anything <br>
			But what that town made me. <br>
			 <br>
			There's always a train where I sleep, <br>
			No matter where, <br>
			All of them, just ghosts of Berryville, Virginia <br>
			Sneaking into my room, rapping on the walls, <br>
			something bound to my child bones. <br>
			When people ask me where I'm from <br>
			I have to say nowhere. <br>
			Anything else would be a lie. <br>
			I could tell them I'm from a dark town, <br>
			Where paper people tear in the rain, <br>
			Where I'm lying across the train tracks <br>
			Dying. <br>

			Fathers think their sons carry on their life on, <br>
			but death is real. <br>

			I get home from work, <br>
			The first day back at work, <br>
			It's so cold outside, seven degrees. <br>
			I lie in bed wearing my wool socks, <br>
			and I see a <br>
			small thing <br>
			a hunched pasty creature <br>
			at the foot of my bed <br>
			and I can't move <br>
			because I know what it is <br>
			because I know it's the price I pay for going to work <br>
			 <br>
			it's here for what work does to me <br>
			it's here because of what I do at work <br>
			what I have to do. <br>

			Can my ghosts be leaving me? <br>
			I've known them for so long it really feels lonely without them. <br>
			I've always told myself, "You can get over trauma" <br>
			I want that to be true. <br>
			I've put my ghosts in my poems and I've trapped them online. <br>
			I'm scared some day to not know a ghost anymore, <br>
			horror is trapping. <br>
			It wraps us, and it is comfortable to be in something's arms. <br>

			I happened upon a quaint selection of poetry, <br>
			from a century and more ago. <br>

			In the South, this racist shit prevails <br>
			like it's stuck here, <br>

			So it sits forever in quaint corners, <br>
			Scaring me away from poetry sections. <br>

			Crying last night, <br>
			I threw out all the love letters that I forgot I had been given, <br>
			And this morning, I tossed the old coffee filter in the trash <br>

			I saw the still-wet grounds dyeing them brown, <br>
			and felt held <br>
			in firm arms <br>

			When I take my eyes off the ground, I get all flighty. <br>

			A tsunami mountain range, <br>

			There's not a light to see <br>
			so our eyes themselves grow darker <br>
			and we sink into a darkness <br>
			that could be mistaken for sleep <br>
			exploring the rock well. <br>
