			The kitchen is the most shared space. <br>

			He’s yelling, and telling me it’s just what he thinks. <br>
			but really he’s got me cornered behind the island, <br>
			and I’m feeling worse than before. <br>
			 <br>
			I’m going to glue my eyes shut <br>
			I’m going to fill my lungs with blood <br>
			I’m cold on the inside. <br>
			Leave me alone in the shade. <br>
			 <br>
			I’m not sensitive, I’m enlightened. <br>
			I love my lonely body. <br>
			I’ve been sharpening the knives. <br>

		<p class="poem">
			Everyone I love ends up at Rehoboth beach. <br>
			Everyone I bring to Rehoboth beach leaves me. <br>
			Their ghosts are with me, <br>
			here, now as I drive across the Bay Bridge. <br>
			I remember what they all said, <br>
			as we approached the monumental arch on the horizon, <br>
			and I asked them if they were afraid of heights. <br>
			I hear you saying it now <br>
			all of you <br>
			all my gone loves <br>
			all in a cacophony <br>
			riding on my back <br>
			reaching for my ear. <br>
			 <br>
			I remember you too vividly because you are here <br>
			some splinter, <br>
			forever in my eye. <br>
			I blink and tear <br>
			but I can’t be rid of you. <br>
			 <br>
			A ghost without a home, <br>
			a ghost outside of soil is a burden, <br>
			so I’ll set you to rest. <br>
			I’ll bury you here, <br>
			on this dark gray beach <br>
			on a rainy day <br>
			in November. <br>
			I’ll put you under damp sand <br>
			packed down, <br>
			in a mass grave, <br>
			where you belong. <br>
			 <br>
			Stay here now, <br>
			you know I’ll come back to see you, <br>
			year in year out, <br>
			against my will, <br>
			I arrive in Rehoboth Beach. <br>
			But I never come alone <br>
			and each of you I bring, <br>
			finds the same fate. <br>
			 <br>
			Maybe one year I won’t make it back. <br>
			Maybe someday the beach front this town dredges back to life every year will wash away <br>
			and the tide will tear through town, <br>
			all through the outlet malls, <br>
			lapping at my mother’s door, <br>
			over you all. <br>
			Then I couldn’t find you <br>
			even if I wanted to. <br>

		<p class="poem">
			Waves of haze, and grey blue <br>
			a grey blanket sky lit by a concealed foreign sun. <br>
			I’ve always wanted to believe I was in control of my life. <br>
			I feel myself bashing around inside my head, <br>
			Not ready to sleep. <br>
			My late night time is shrinking and expanding, <br>
			I’ve been setting silent alarms to know the time. <br>
			I see Lily sitting up working in her sketchbook <br>
			I get up and sit across from her <br>
			At the cafe table in the discount hotel room at Rehoboth Beach. <br>
			I tell her about a dream I keep having where I’m rowing, <br>
			And how I always wake up with my hands folded across my chest <br>
			coffin style. <br>
			And she gets it all too well. <br>
			I don’t tell her last night I had a dream she is the horse death rides, <br>
			Because I know she’d take it too seriously. <br>
			 <br>
			We get dressed for the cold and wander outside. <br>
			Come Summer, this side of town is full of drunks. <br>
			We walk further and further, <br>
			Pushing each other on wordlessly. <br>
			We walk off the sidewalk, <br>
			To a ferry launch, <br>
			The street lamps that light the parking lot are dark besides a single row <br>
			A line from the gated entrance to the tailgate of a chugging boat, <br>
			Waiting there for us. <br>
			 <br>
			We’re shooting backwards side by side against the back rail. <br>
			Out from the inlet with the ferry landing, we turn North towards New Jersey. <br>
			I look to my phone for an alarm to go off, <br>
			I can’t see it in the light contrast <br>
			The spotlight on the deck illuminates my back. <br>
			 <br>
			I imagine someone on the shore looking out, seeing my silhouette outlined in the darkness. <br>
			I see a cluster of lights appearing to the northwest along the horizon, <br>
			I don’t know that city, <br>
			Our distance from that nameless coastal city makes it mythical. <br>
			 <br>
			The cold atlantic sea salted sand breeze spray from the ship crashing through the water is the only thing I’m sure of. <br>
			The ghost city passes into the darkness behind us <br>
			And we’ve lost hold on our location. <br>
			We’re on the sea splitting barge to the outside of time. <br>
			 <br>
			In the same uniform dark <br>
			We crash into underwater wood cracking splintering teeter screech of metal tearing <br>
			We look up to the invisible captain <br>
			And he’s nowhere to be found. <br>
			Lily leans over the rail to look into the soup, <br>
			“I can see something sticking up out of the water.” <br>
			She climbs over, and jumps down, I follow her and jump too. <br>
			She’s already starting down a staircase in the metal island. <br>
			I look back at the empty barge rising and falling. <br>
			I always find  myself walking behind you. <br>
			 <br>
			I step down underground and it’s all dim lit nowhere godless fog, <br>
			I search for you but you’ve gotten away from me. <br>
			The ground is damp cold sand, <br>
			I wake up on the beach <br>
			The clouds are stifling the sunrise. <br>
			I promise to my empty image of you, <br>
			I promise I’ll think of this kindly, <br>
			I promise I won’t hurt myself again. <br>
			 <br>
			And when I get back to the hotel room Lily’s gone, <br>
			And I wonder if she was ever here at all, <br>
			Or if she just drove home without a word <br>
			Like she does. <br>
			 <br>
			As I round Baltimore it starts to rain small drops <br>
			And the smell leaks through the AC. <br>
			Perhaps I’m mindless. <br>

			What if I told you I work in a closet, <br>
			I couldn't lay down in <br>
			A tomb too small to lie in. <br>
			I remember seeing the different ways native people were buried, <br>

			Im native to the closet. <br>
			I was born in here. <br>
			The beetles crawling along the wall and I call this <br>

			The first cold day of Fall, <br>
			The first one that’s no longer pleasant. <br>
			There’s a fine rain, <br>
			and it’s grounding all the leaves at once. <br>
			They’re floating on puddles like Fall lilies. <br>
			Caustic yellow <br>
			like gasoline on the surface of the pond. <br>
			Color like the hood of a spitting snake, <br>
			Warning sign, death in the chilled afternoon air. <br>
			 <br>
			Beauty often an omen, change not always for the best. <br>
			 <br>
			And the last warm day, <br>
			recollected, as all good days are, <br>
			only known when there’re no good <br>
			days <br>
			left. <br>

			It’s all cold now, holiday horror, marathon dinners at dad’s <br>
			family forgotten you’re gay <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (or chose to) <br>
			and tries to set you up. <br>
			I remember the last good talk with Dad. <br>
			It was this time of year, years ago. <br>
			He’s so like me, I feel myself magnetized to his mind. <br>
			 <br>
			He’s so cold now, <br>
			we don’t talk now. <br>
			I visit in the winter, I don’t know why I still come here. <br>
			A father like winter, dead-frosted tired hateful and <br>
			unbiased in uniform stoic gaze. <br>
			 <br>
			Polarity drove my mother away, <br>
			my beach mother, mother like Summer. <br>
			An undying sun, burning me. <br>
			The heat seems unnatural to me, <br>
			She brings people joy, <br>
			I don’t understand those people, <br>
			I don’t understand her. <br>
			 <br>
			They’re different by design. <br>
			I wonder if they weren't always this way, <br>
			If people become their solstice over time. <br>
			 <br>
			I’m falling, <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sometimes I feel my fate <br>
			in the cold limp freeze, <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  all color drained to pale blue. <br>
			until then I’m firey, <br>
			until then, breathe me in <br>
			I’m here with you. <br>

		<p class="poem">
			Look now <br> 
			Taking the match in my hand <br>
			I tap it downwards against the strike pad <br> 
			galloping flame opens <br>
			Some matches burn straight, <br>
			Other matches burn in layers. <br>
			If you hold a match vertically it'll drown <br>
			So let the flame creep up the sideways wood <br> 
			And begin to melt your fingers, <br>
			It turns into a mountain shape <br> 
			And blinks in the wind. <br> 
			When it dies its spirit lingers in the black body, <br> 
			It still burns inside, <br>
			but you can see it leave <br>
			as a last breath of smoke. <br>
			 <br> 
			Books though <br> 
			Books burn thick. <br> 
			If you open one up and drop a match on the spine <br> 
			The book bloats and won't close <br> 
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - All the pages turn black and wrinkle into brittle sheets. <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When you slam it clodes it keeps burning on the inside <br> 
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp And ash plumes out the top. <br>
			 <br> 
			I burn matches <br>
			I breathe smoke <br>
			From cigarettes <br>
			To make a moment stick around <br> 
			On my fingers and lips <br>
			Until the next morning <br>
			When I wake up and smell it again <br>
			And know I wasn't faking. <br>
			 <br> 
			When it's night <br>
			And there are no cars driving <br>
			I sit on the street and close my eyes. <br> 
			It's passive danger <br> 
			I could die <br> 
			But probably I won't <br> 
			And I haven't yet <br> 
			So I keep going <br> 
			I like to have my fate <br>
			Out of my hands <br> 
			 <br> 
			Let the match drop into the dark <br> 
			We're all sleeping soundly now <br> 
			Dreams sit on top of the water <br> 
			They undulate like waves <br> 
			They are tubling <br>
			Down in a hole <br> 
			Snaking like smoke on air <br> 
			Suspension in a fluid <br>
			Drifting like snow on breezes <br> 
			Grouped and curling <br> 
			At the bottom of a <br> 
			well <br> 
			 <br> 
			The depths of the darkness around me can only be measured by the distance between my brain and the backs of my eyelids <br> 
			To Light A Match <br> 
			Illuminates my hands and face <br> 
			But it only scratches at the darkness. <br> 
			 <br> 
			Somewhere deep <br> 
			We all want to live forever. <br> 
			This is where religion should dive in to save me. <br> 
			Deeply forsaken, <br> 
			I'm lost in a bog <br>
			I can't move my legs below the knee. <br> 
			Cut off my arms and paint me grey <br> 
			I am beautiful in this field of red and black <br>

		<p class="poemTitle">The only thing in Berryville, Virginia is the Train</p>
		<p class="poem">
			The rails whistle if you put your ear to them <br> 
			At 3:00 o’clock on Friday nights. <br> 
			We would stay to see it come and stop <br> 
			Lying across the tracks <br> 
			Tossing empty bottles. <br> 
			I'd picture myself being severed into three pieces <br> 
			across the rails. <br> 
			 <br> 
			There are two sets of parallel tracks in the small town. <br> 
			A train slows and stops every time <br> 
			And we climb on in the clear winter moon. <br> 
			The freight of steel containers <br> 
			And the whole shape <br> 
			frozen cold. <br> 
			We wait and watch other trains go by <br> 
			inches away <br> 
			Hauling coal from West Virginia on the twin rail <br> 
			We swing our legs <br> 
			We talk about growing older. <br> 
			 <br> 
			When the train begins to crawl again <br> 
			it starts a series of gunshots <br> 
			clasping hands all along the resting chain. <br> 
			We stay on the train as it begins to move. <br> 
			The cold speeding air asks me to ride the train somewhere else. <br> 
			Through the wild buffeting I hear screaming. <br> 
			When I jump off, <br> 
			Into the crunch of rocks, <br> 
			it's all silent, besides the <br> 
			clockwork thunk of the train moving on. <br> 
			 <br> 
			I like to lay between a pair of tracks <br> 
			With my hands crossed like a coffin <br> 
			And imagine a train avalanching over me. <br> 
			 <br> 
			We would lie in the streets <br> 
			And die together <br> 
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp so slowly. <br> 
			Some of us did die there, <br> 
			The rest are cursed to remember, <br> 
			To be authors and artists <br> 
			Because we've been graced with the unique small town experience. <br> 
			We would sit in the rain <br> 
			And die. <br> 
			 <br> 
			This plague town <br> 
			The ground is falling out <br> 
			And the bedrooms are filling <br> 
			From the ceiling to the floor with <br> 
			Thick dripping darkness. <br> 
			Some people know how they'll die. <br> 
			I'll die from silence. <br> 
			Dark breeding asphyxiation. <br> 
			 <br> 
			I don't have the moral authority <br> 
			To convince myself that I'm anything <br> 
			But what that town made me. <br> 
			 <br> 
			There's always a train where I sleep, <br> 
			No matter where, <br> 
			All of them, just ghosts of Berryville, Virginia <br> 
			Sneaking into my room, rapping on the walls, <br> 
			something bound to my child bones. <br> 
			When people ask me where I'm from <br> 
			I have to say nowhere. <br> 
			Anything else would be a lie. <br> 
			I could tell them I'm from a dark town, <br> 
			Where paper people tear in the rain, <br> 
			Where I'm lying across the train tracks <br> 
			Dying. <br>
