Childish irritation towards events outside my control. Never opening my eyes. Squinting at the reds and blues behind my eyelids. Going back to sleep seems like the best option at this point.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Awakening again from a rocky sleep. Thoughts of ancient memories in such early morning hours seemed too much like dreams. I tried to remember where I had stopped the day before. Days blurred together with mismatched context. Repetition can sometimes have that effect.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Next to a creek. It was warm, but trees were in their fall colors. There were centipedes inside my blanket. I rather hate bugs. I got up and brushed myself off, pretending to just be enjoying the warm morning air, in case of mysterious onlookers watching me from deep in the forest. A bed of leaves had disguised the uncomfortable ground where I had been sleeping. Not one of my better nights. I stumbled towards my pack and found my state-map while a yawn opened me. I traced the line on my improvised map to where I had last marked my progress (at some point i had decided to plot a course on my wanderings). I would find the lake today. It may be warm enough to swim.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I set off towards the rising sun and walked through the brush along the ground. Plowing along, not caring where I stepped. My eyes were busy elsewhere. I had always loved fall the most out of all seasons, I was born late in fall, so it had always been a reliably wonderful time of year for me growing up. Growing up, however was oddly bereft. I had friends but found myself often out of place. I was always told I would have fit In better on the west coast as I grew older. A west coast summer boy, born in the grips of fall, but I love them both just the same.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Stepping over logs and under vines, thinking of how I consistently confused myself in my youth. During my first ten years I was as happy as a boy could be, but after that time period I found myself becoming extremely depressed. Everything I had been living was no longer real. School served me no purpose, but I excelled in all subjects of learning. In school I acted as a comedian, because I wanted people to know that I was real. I was unsure of my place in the world, and from this uncertainty grew the issues that blanketed my adolescence. I created a facade to place myself behind at all times, so that i could appear joyful, while still weathering depression. Over the years I lost myself, and I forgot who i was. I had been split into a physical being and a metaphysical, with the latter half nowhere to be found. To be in society, but to not have a personality to fall back on, is a vicious torture of men. Impacts on a surface that receives the changes, but instead of properly adjusting, is left unchanged. Like rocks falling through smoke, I was a child without a spirit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">As I came to this conclusion the ground started to fall off to my left, into a shallow glade. There had to be a creek at its base, and surely that would flow into our lake. I stood for a second contemplating my way down through the thick underbrush of thorned chords and brittle trees. The thorn bushes looked like waves on a stormy sea. I decided to stay atop the small ridge where I currently stood. I could see the sun here, and it was probably cold in the shade of the valley. I followed my deer trail, feeling like a train bound to its rails.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Maybe i&#39;m a liar today. It tends to change daily. Rationalization of a false course. I have been more aware in my most recent years. Awakening from my dreams of smoke and pain for a time to sit and enjoy the world. I was not always such a philosopher, but now that I have time to think while on my journey, it comes up quite often.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Hah. Sometimes it strikes me how much I can annoy myself... Whenever I talk in my head, I explain things as if I were telling my thoughts to someone else. If I skip to quickly over words or feel as if my point was not properly illustrated, I have to retrace myself and reiterate. It becomes quite tedious on occasion. To some degree, none of that foolishness matters. Everything is just about the motion. Steps towards the goal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">In the time between two steps, cold rain began to fall. Mud rose from beneath the dead grass and I continued my walk. My path became lost before me, but I could still manage to stay on the crest of the ridge. I had never understood people who hid from the rain. The rain was the most beautiful thing that had ever happened to me. Cold rain is like pure focus. When it surrounds you everything is executed to the proper parameters mechanically. The human body lets the brain wander as it toils on, not complaining, burdened constantly by human habit and preference. I remembered days long gone by. Days before the stars and the rain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I started walking after taking my shoes off. The ground was uniformly damp. It had not been raining where I had been. The bus had just dropped me off at my high school and I was walking home, because my parents were not there to pick me up. I wouldn&#39;t have to walk far. It was cloudy, ruining my view of the night. It was close to a new moon so the sky was entirely made up of clouds, bubbles on the surface of the heavens. I could see only one constellation. The seven sisters were sitting there, in a hole in the sky. Stars always held some fundamental significance in my mind. The science half of myself was in love with the idea of stars. Something about one constellation alone in the ether brought me to an earthshaking conclusion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I found the true purpose of symbolism. I had always scoffed at those who found human lives to be symbolic, but at that moment, I found that a symbol is a reflection of yourself. You have to observe your own observations. What you see in any literature, music, or art is a reflection of your innermost feelings towards that piece. Literature can have face value, which is the fact that it is interesting to read. Literature can also have symbolism within it that relates to the story, but there is also another level existing beneath that. It stems from your own recognition of the symbols you find when looking for them. I find that the mathematical procedure of taking the derivative to be an accurate metaphor for this situation. The first level is displacement, the next is the change in displacement over time, in other words velocity. The third is the change in velocity over time, which is acceleration. Understanding the third level of your mind gives you a reference to your own acceleration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Wrenching my pants away from a thorn bush which seems to want them more than I. Ripped jeans are such an eternal circumstance in a situation like mine. A scar that stays with you as long as you let it. Ripping and pulling. Cutting the flesh due to such uncontrollable irritation. I remind myself of Maslow&rsquo;s triangle.</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2 c5">Tiers 1 &amp; 2 &ndash; Physiological and Safety Needs</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2 c5">Tiers 3 &amp; 4 &ndash; Belonging and Esteem Needs</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2 c5">Tier 5 &ndash; Self Actualization</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I firmly believe in Maslow&rsquo;s top, with Self Actualization moved from the top to the bottom. As rebellious as this sounds, I believe the world balances upon the realizations of potential. One man who realizes his full potential can lead her followers to change the world and its impression upon itself. Although, who has ever changed all of society? No one could unify the spreading roots of culture. I had long ago removed myself from the bowl. I had yearned for the world to take me into it&rsquo;s hands, and to let &nbsp;nature leave my tiers one and two to me. It is a contagious desire, that I tempted many a friend with. All I wished for was to be able to sustain myself here, if nature would only let me. I will find myself here: as I wander with squinted eyelids in clouded afternoon haze, I continue, through the rain and sleet. To believe Self Actualization to come first leads me in hope.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">When the rain falls the mind moves away from the body, and you are the mind. A mind inside a brain inside the body. The mind is what makes you up. Our only companion through life and death, who stands behind our eyes and whispers out our ears. Self Actualization is the only thing left sacred. It is for human brains and for the earth to not comprehend. I want to know that there is something about me that is significant, and i see it in the top tier, which i am sure is the bottom, of a dead mans thoughts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; I turn my eyes skyward. Clouds above me running. Clouds like sand dunes. Clouds like steam. Clouds like oceans of currents, throwing the water up to me from the breaking waves. Clouds on the ground. Clouds below me in the valley. A lake of clouds, filled to the brim.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; A most mysterious scene. I was drawn to it. The valley was covered in a fog that ended right before my feet, at the lip of the glade. Powdered. Like a world through heavy eyelids.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I enjoyed fog once.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">There was a path down that I saw, and I moved towards it. I stood at the edge of an abyss made by my own mind. I looked out and saw the trees rising from within it. Young trees, still narrow, but tall and bare, looking more like roots than branches. Short trees like fountains of fireworks. Shooting slowly upwards. I waded into the mist, as I moved I did not displace it, but instead we shared the space. There is room for both.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">When inside, the rain was gone but everything was soaking. Terror rose inside me from some most basic part of my nature. I felt as though my mind had lost my body on its adventures in metaphysicality. I was sinking into the lake of mist, and my mind weighed me down like the ancient metal diving suit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">When in fog it spawns creations out of itself. Perhaps there was a wall of fog on the end of the world. Creating the new. It creates before you and deletes behind. You are the single point around which existence revolves. And outside of existence is right where the demons lie. Always on the edge. Of vision. Of existence. When the coldest rain falls, and darkness rises, the mind goes to work in devious fashions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights flickered and were stamped out. Deep in the endless inescapable trench, I was trapped.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">A fog like someone just blurred your eyes to what lies beyond them. Until a light comes. Twin lights. Flying silently. Rumbles unheard behind glass walls. Wrecking.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Dampness. It is everywhere. Running to look for wood not soaked through. My legs move too fast beneath my slow torso. The world it slick and smooth, like ice made from an old melted snow, in a graveyard never touched by visitors. Slipping and slamming into my waist. I curl in wrenching pain from the rock hammering my pulsing side. Ball my fists.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Up.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coals from the previous day are in my pack (good for fires). Enough branches. Starting a fire.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; I hunch over on both knees, with my hair hanging over my face. It had escaped from my bandana. My hands work faster than my eyes can see in the failed light. I swear I can hear snickering all around me when I fail time and again to ignite the crushed leaves. The deep woods onlookers. My lungs heave. Fierce anger rises in me as I begin to slash away at my usually reliable flint and magnesium brick. My eyes are closed when it catches. I lean back from the already growing fire, thankful. I look around in confusion at the dancers around me. They jump and spin in lively action. Shorter trees like fountains of fireworks. Burning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I saw a ghost next to the fire. She smiled at me through the smoke. I told her she looked beautiful in the light, as she sank in the dark.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Lighting a fire only sets limits to the enveloping darkness. Quantifying an infinite value. Red parallelograms shifting before closed eyes, perhaps opened. The depth of the darkness around me can only be measured in the distance between my brain and the backs of my eyelids. I back up to a tree and ride its trunk to the ground. The smoke from my fire curls towards me. I can&#39;t breathe. I can&#39;t move. They will see me. I will see them. It will see itself. We sleep at night so we don&#39;t have to watch the shadows. Put out the lights. They aren&#39;t really what scares you, but they are the packet it is sent through.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Beating of a heart and white noise surround me. The fire seems miles away. Choking. Eyes shut. Tight enough so the thoughts cannot escape and materialize around me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Whispers of sleep attach to me swiftly. They come in waves. Layers of darkness fall down under my eyes. Darker and darker, but this darkness is not terror, it is peaceful.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Falling into dreams like a log settles in the fire. It reaches a certain point then shifts suddenly. A dramatic change that takes place in less than an instant. Sinking into place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Dreams sit on top of the water.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">They undulate like waves.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">They are tumbling.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Down in the well.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Snaking like smoke on air,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Suspension in a fluid.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Drifting like snow on breezes,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Never touching the edges.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Grouped and curling.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Dreams of water themes.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Forthcoming</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">In a quiet hallway, due to silence, lived a solid rock. It never moved and it was always happy. The ladybug and mouse came to visit whenever the slightest doubt of loneliness was in its rock mind. The ladybug would bring flower petals for the rock and the mouse would bring bread crumbs. They would all have a picnic, and remember how happy they are. The rock would not be lonely anymore, or sad. The hallway would still be silent, and the rock would still live there by itself. As years passed hallways became streams, as they often do, and the rock sat above the silent flowing water. Silt collected abound his base and he became an island. He remembered the friends he had (rocks have eternal memories), and at that very moment a ladybug, very much like his long gone friend, flew down through the sunbeams and fluttered upon his peak. At the same time, a boat, that may or may not have been a large leaf, drifted down the steady current, and docked itself upon the rock&#39;s steady shore. From the leaf, a small mouse appeared. Together they rested and slept, forgetting themselves in the quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The wind was playing the grass and the leaves. It was a seasoned expert. Years upon centuries of practice. The wind speaks through the trees and the grass. It is the consciousness of nature. It whispers, and it sings.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I always wake up with my eyes closed. I always think about it when it happens. It is crisp today. The weather reminds me of the crunch of apples. It reminds me of when I lived under a water tower. The water tower was the first place I went after the train. So long ago. It was a cool day then too. Very early spring. G unisons ringing out from trains rumbling not too far off, echoing around the landscape. We rode the train south. Jumped on when it stopped in our town. It was a place where trains would let one another pass. The train invited us aboard. It was a freight train, so we road on the outer edge. It was so fast. We only road for the shortest time, we used it to escape, because I didn&rsquo;t want to take my car. I didn&rsquo;t own it, It was my parents really, not mine. It would have been rude to take it I think. It was so long ago. It is almost hard to remember.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I feel wonderful. Sometimes all it takes is one night to kick the pretentious away.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I could hear birds. By now I had accidentally opened my eyes a few times. Pretending to never have let the light in, and holding on to the smoky dreamscape was more fun than accepting defeat. I got up without opening my eyes and whistled back to the birds. I love singing to them. It may just be me inserting myself into their own rhythms, but it always seemed as if they waited for me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">All the sounds swirled around me as a companion breeze picked up and rolled along the ground between the trees and me. My note rhymed with the wind and the chorus of the land took shape. The music grabbed me suddenly and threw me skyward. My hairs stood up to catch it. Fingers starred. White blinds eyes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The human body feels the music. Plant your feet and raise your arms. It builds itself inside you. Anything that raises people to great heights without the need to say a word may be influential beyond measure. The world had risen while I slept, and the storm had brought out the instruments.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;The beauty dimmed suddenly as it often does and I inspected my surroundings slowly. My site seem utterly normal. It wasn&rsquo;t even the slightest bit wet. The rain must not have fallen at all. Pack against tree, fire blackened out. Motions of the morning took shift.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;The eye toll booth. Give both eyes to the blind man on the way into Dreams, and your refurbished pair awaits you when you leave. He may not have had the entire allotted time to clean them, in which case watch for symptoms of drowsiness and heavy eyelids! It doesn&#39;t happen now as much as it used to in the days before dreams and lakes. Great nights filled with dream sleep are incredibly motivating. Before I left I remember breaking out of human habits. I would wake up in the earliest moments of the day, where everything is silent. To break such silence is blasphemous. I would awaken from sleep and write. I would call it early morning and it would never be touched again, and it is for reading in the morning, in the time in which it was written.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Final assembling done: off. The day long journey seems to be expanding. My map &nbsp; obviously does not take into account mountain ranges. I probably should&#39;ve seen this coming... I purchased it from a convenience store in that last small village town. I guess I&#39;m lucky the map even shows the lake. It is supposed to be a very famous lake. The landscape was covered with orange lines cracking over the paper, hiking trails were often more difficult than the landscape ever intended them to be. I was going straight towards the lake, through the mountains and valleys. I&#39;m sure it will all turn out alright. Steps in motion.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;Today the weather was missing. The temperature was static and the sky was a shadowless wall of blue, It faded to white in a circle around the lamp, and had black cracks where the trees grew too tall.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;Now. To the lake, to the lake, to the lake. Maybe I&#39;ll get there and she&#39;ll be swimming. My pace quickens. I&#39;m not even sure if she likes to swim. Anything is possible at this point I suppose.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;When we left she was with me. We had talked about going the entire winter previous. We talked about the rails of life, and how it was impossible to be anything besides what everyone else was. We lost each other recently, but we were headed to the same place. We were in the last town and I had to run, so I ran. We had never spoken of &nbsp;a way of meeting again. Without any means of communication, thoughts speak volumes. She will be there eventually. I&rsquo;ll find a good log to sit on, or a sad stump that I will give some friendship. I&rsquo;ll whistle out in bird tones and wait for her appearance around the bend of the water.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;We picked the lake from the store in the last town. It was the shape of a lava lamp triangle. I thought it looked magnificent. It was the only lake we had.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;The landscape began to change, there were more rocks peeking from the ground, and the trees grew coarse and thick. The great mountain sloped upwards before me, and my creek bed withered off to the left. The slope was not steep, but it was surely tall. It would not be a problem.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;Continuing forward was more strenuous as the altitude rose. Vergil&rsquo;s thin air gripped my lungs. &nbsp;Leaves sometimes rotted beneath me and I slipped slightly. I stretched forward at one point to grab a limb and felt a tear in my jeans give slightly. Questioningly pondering on this for a half second I remembered, without looking, that its origin was the bush in the rain the previous day. Maybe the rain was still sitting beneath the leaves, slowly rotting them away.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;The more work was done, the less I found myself thinking. With hard work comes an absence of thought. I remember when I would run in the park after school in the fall, before trees and leaves. I usually found myself breathing to the rhythm of a null child rhyme or some sort of dancing tempo. I had never danced a step in my life.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;When I grabbed a tree it let go of some of its leaves. They fell in shifting phases. Leaves on the air must think that they feel a lot like boats on the water.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;I found a rocky zone where I began to make much better time. Rocks gave way beneath me on occasion, but to no detrimental conclusion. I knew how to handle myself, not to say I was an expert, but I had been hiking many times in my small town near the base of a far off mountain range. I was so far from my home here. The entire landscape was different. The fauna here knew I was a stranger and glared at me menacingly. I dare not disturb it. I knew my world well; a town near a different range, that many people here may not even know.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not often find myself nostalgic here in this place that I wished for so fiercely, but when I remember friends and smells long gone, I too feel my chest turn down slightly as my brow furrows. This is where I wanted to be, but in reality I failed everyone I knew and there was not denying that. I was no longer in reality. To them I was a failed experiment on the course to an engineering degree, who met a composer and escaped the world they tolerated without question. The glass is less curved on the outside.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;She did not turn me, she just told me I was not the only one. When we left she was with me. Upon our escape, we honestly laid beneath the night. I remember saying,&quot;Why should we even sleep? Lets break every convention we&#39;ve ever considered. Lets run in the rain all night and sleep all day.&quot; She just told me I was not alone. Hah, maybe talking in your head always turns romantic at some point. I mean romantic in the true meaning of the word of course, not the foolish Valentines nonsense that seems to stand in front of the real meaning nowadays... Then again, I may not know so much about nowadays at all anymore. The country could be at war for all I knew. I was a bug in a stump, independent from the canopy&rsquo;s shade or sun.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;I curled above the summit suddenly. It was not a small top, it was not a sharp point, I just found myself there, like the beginning of a dream. My rockslide had led most of the way up. I absorbed the landscape thoroughly and smiled. Miles and miles to see, all at the same moment, with a flick of an eye moving days away. I saw rocky cliff not too far to my right that was calling to me, and in my present mindset I could not resist. I set off toward the outcropping with a warm breeze ripping my hair across my face. It has grown so long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">And so I sat upon the jetting rock looking out from the mountain towards the lake below. The sun stood before me and I was shot in spirit to such great heights. This is everything I left for. Everything I&#39;ve ever felt meets here. I&#39;m born. Maybe this is where I&#39;ve been waiting for myself for an eternity. The ebb and flow in tide and the posthumous glow of the heavens has brought me here. I am anchored. I remember this. The wind and the bright sun remind me of so many wonderful thoughts. I hope it rains soon. I want the rain to be warm, and fall on the land like silk. I want to be happy for an eternity. This is why I left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Think of something great. Roll on the ground. Jump really high. Live like me. Enjoy every second of everything because the next, the depression may have caught you. Joy bottles much better than sadness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">The sun was setting so I watched. I was not opposed to walking at night. I wanted to sit for a while, and breathe at the top of my mountain. I am the landscape. I will surely see you soon. I am the weather, all of it, not just the rain or wind. I am atmospheric. With the air I exist, and upon untrodden moss I bound. I scream. I shine through. Yelling off the top of the cliff. Maybe she hears me, so far off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I can feel it. It is a call for wolves, but for men, so far gone from their ancestors, it is a dull roar at the nape of their necks. It rises behind men&#39;s eyes and rides them through fury. The mortal world twinkles away and nature wraps fully and deeply. The touch of the ground. The wet underearth. A sharp cold breeze that doesn&rsquo;t seem to burn like you remember. The tall unbroken sky. It is a rising feeling. It is a song. Unbroken notes ringing in ears unhearing. No lonely man, nor joyous man will hear the tone. He must be wise and filled with an unnatural rigor, and must desire to fly in spirit. He will never be destroyed and always questioned. The wolves like him will be drawn to him, and he will lead them over the damp underearth. Through valleys and rivers and &#39;round lakes eternally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Remember me</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">when fall mornings smell like spring,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">and the dew is not yet a frost.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">When the grass is alive,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">but the leaves have fallen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Think of me,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">because I live for that moment.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">A life between the cracks.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">Rising</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;Walking down from mountains is harder than going up. There is a lot of falling on leaning trees involved. The trees go upwards, even if they sit on a slope. How cute, their posture is impeccable. Trees are very formal creatures. &nbsp;They are easy to trust, due to their polite nature. I remember once, when I was small, I was standing on a wooden chair at our kitchen table, and my father warned me that the chair wasn&rsquo;t safe. It wasn&rsquo;t stable. It scared me quite a bit, but now I can see safe trees. Some trees are hiding their rueful intentions under rotten roots. Party crashers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;The light fell with my descent. My timing was flawless, I reached the bottom of the slope just as the lamp left, and I stood with a bright moon in front of me. The moon was not full yet, waxing. I knew about stars and astronomy before leaving. Now I can spot some constellations, and I could figure out my bearing if I really needed to, but it had never turned out to be useful. My favorites were Pleiades and Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia was almost always in the sky, due to its proximity to the north star, and Pleiades was wonderful to look at through a telescope. Almost too bright for the lense.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;The trees cast shadows everywhere, but this light tonight was not menacing in the slightest. I did not feel terror this time. I walked on joyfully.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;I often sing songs and hum and whistle while alone. It is not to fill the absence of company, it is just that I do not want to bother others with noise. My vision ahead scares away small creatures hiding in the underbrush, they would be much safer if they sat still.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;I find the moments when you notice you are not tired to be strange occurrences. It is a feeling like when you think you find some massive unknown detail of the universe. Your rational mind tells you that many more brilliant minds before you have thought much longer than you have about such topics. Investigate nevertheless. It is like a dream when you are driving along a road you know well enough to drive blind, but your pedals have been reversed and the brakes will not work. Your friend is in the front seat. Don&rsquo;t look like a fool. Stay safe young man.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I step forward on a thick enough branch. Two cracks. A crack and a clash. Thick sound recedes in the forest as all eyes turn to me in disgust. How embarrassing. The curved side of the demoralized branch turns limply, swinging by its weight. Out in the forest, an impossible distance away, a deer dashes off.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Shock of such noise is incredible. Intentional sound is accepted, but such sharp ungrateful noise is confusing. It&#39;s like reading on a bus ride. Smooth as night till a bump, then you move so swiftly (too swiftly) from world to world. It is often impossible to trace the line back to where you started. You may be able to find the page, but the atmosphere has dissipated.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;I look down and gather myself. Look up and continue forward. I began to whistle a folk song I remembered from a summer festival once in my town. It was too happy to break the dark.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;A little bit off I heard the hiss of water on a road as a car pushes it up and around its tires. I couldn&rsquo;t see the lights from here. It must be below a hill I cannot find in the night.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;After more forward progress I came upon the line in the forest. This brought up my spirits. It was surely the road to the lake. It was a very famous lake.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;I hiked up my backpack and let loose a broad smile in the night, following the downward slope. The road was firm beneath my feet. I was excited to be in the dark here. I was excited to be on my way. Motion is everything. I had gone, and that was everything.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I remember a car ride through a town falling apart, giving way to fast food chains. Once agrarian now succumbing to industrialization. Fogged windows trying to shield you from the details. All I needed to see was the gas prices and the boarded windows. Bumping through listening to depressed brit-pop. Goodbye courage. Hello sadness. It was impossible for me to call myself a human. I felt like I couldn&#39;t be grouped with people that lived like this. I did not have any thoughts of being better, or being smarter than these people, I just knew I was not the same.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another turn in the road. I loved how roads bank to ease sharp turns.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a toll booth and a lane on either side. It was all dark, but lit in the moonlight. Millions of signs warning of disobeyed rules littered the upcoming entrance. I walked in through the right lane, and down the gravel path. There were people camping in tents and vehicles on both sides of the road. There were thick trees, weathered by years of hammocks and childsplay, whose leaves speckled the light.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;I walked all the way towards the lake. There was a buoyed zone where children could swim safely. I could see the moon in the lake. It was not a large lake, I could see its entire perimeter, but this side was obviously the inhabited side. On the other side there were high standing weeds and the trees were dense. Algae grew on the lid of the body of water. None ventured there besides unstoppable youths proving points. They surely jumped off of the tall rocks. Betrayal of the sign&rsquo;s trust.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;She would be on the other side of the lake, over there. I would not be able to find her in the dark. I did not have a place to sleep here in this world of faux-woods. I would go to the other side and find a place to wait, or sleep; one would come eventually.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">There was a wooden bridge that crossed over the creek to my left that walked by the woods, then back up to the sleeping campers. I followed it, broke off of it, and jumped over the initial underbrush: soon into the wild again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">It was a thick group of trees, due to the proximity to the water source. Most trees were thinner, but there were not tall old trees there. I wandered about, waiting for a place to grab me. I found it. There was a cut stump. It looked so sad here alone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I saw it from the outside edge of a circle. The circle was without trees, and was tall with thin grass. The stump had been alone for a long time. It was worn down. The edges were curved smooth from rain and rain. It was not rotted. It was solid and stoic like a giant tortoise.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I went and bent over in front of it. I looked at it and listened for it to let me know I was welcome. A grasshopper played near me on the other side of the meadow. I sat upon the stump with my head on my palm, and my elbow in the dip before my knee. I closed my eyes limply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c2 c5">Walking through the sad town. It is still wet here. This side of the mountain must have gotten more clouds. Maybe it always does. The evergreens were starting to turn brown. Maybe the soil was turning ill. &nbsp;You can&#39;t see the fall colors from here. This town had potential to be beautiful. I walked down the road with her by my side and we glowed in the shadow of the despair. A young woman asked us who we were. I said we were the Transcendentalist revolution. She sighed and smiled with her head turned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Opening my eyes swiftly. I was falling off of my perch.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">It was daylight, and the ringing of laughter filled the atmosphere around the lake. I could hear splashing. Today felt so free.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I recovered from my fall immediately, and jumped up from my chair. I felt great today. I wanted to dance around in the woods and climb trees and roll in green grass. It felt like joy had been poured into me during the night. It was wonderful.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I wandered out of the forest the same way I had entered. I saw people sunbathing on the manufactured sand beach, and I noticed I was not feeling as scornful as my mind usually was. I hated the idea of bettering yourself by turning a different shade. Foolishness. I just saw them and decided that was what they wanted to be doing, just like how I wanted to be jumping and dancing and running.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I walked up through the park towards a centralized facility for showers and bathrooms I had seen on my way in. I hoped they would have a water fountain. I wanted to refill my bottles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">As I walked I gazed around inspecting my surroundings peacefully. I felt like I was in a dream here. This place was where the people I had left came to feel like me. I saw families and groups of friends eating and laughing. Vacations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I followed the side of a gravel road towards the center of the park where I remembered the building. A car passed by kicking up dry dust from the road, their vacation has ended.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">There was a water fountain between the entrances for men and women. I filled up four water bottles and replaced them in my backpack. The water looked clean. I walked back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">On my way I saw a family that stuck out more than others. They had a pink dressed baby and a small boy. The father was grilling and the mother sat laughing with her head turned upwards. I passed by them as they settled down to eat. On my approach the baby watched me blankly. I always loved looking at babies, so I smiled back as wide as I could and laughed to myself. The baby cracked a giggle and her mother waved me over happily. They must have chosen me due to my appearance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">They were sitting against a van not far from the road. They had parked near a stationary grill and picnic table. The father was a thin tall-ish man, dressed in a light blue button up shirt. Their mother was slim and young, with blonde brown hair. They offered to share some food and asked me to stay a while. I was not opposed to this in the slightest, and embraced the day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">We all sat at the table with paper plates and plastic utensils. Mother with children on their side, and the father and I on the other. We ate quickly and I thanked them for it through the meal. After, the children ran off to play and the father took all of our plates into their van where they had a black trash bag.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I had been expecting some questions, but so far they had been very light. They had asked how old I was and if I was here alone. They responded as one might imagine to my answers. Maybe they were not the right ones, I always loved multiple choice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">As the father left the mother leaned back and asked me where I was from. I told her I was from the forest. I had been a breeze through a window, and had walked right on through. To &nbsp;this, her reaction surprised me. She pulled in a long breath and let it go, closing her eyes as she did. Absorbing the landscape. I recognized her technique. She opened her eyes and smiled at me. I felt like she was proud of me. She knew more than I did about what I had done apparently.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">As her husband came back to the table their son ran over and jumped on his lap. The man gave a hard breath under his son&rsquo;s weight, and then asked me, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name stranger?&rdquo;. I called myself Ivy and shook his hand solidly. His son then suddenly jumped out with his hand outstretched as well. I looked him straight in the eyes happily and gave him a handshake to untie years of questions and falsehoods. I could see the surprise on his face. The gift was real. I shouted it out to him from behind layers of human consciousness. He could hear, but he would not understand for years. I knew that if everything else I had left the world to gain was lost today, this single victory would be worth a thousand lives lost in the woods.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The father laughed at his son&rsquo;s try at manliness. I said I was so very grateful for the meal, but I needed to be going. I didn&rsquo;t want to be late. They took the news of my departure happily. I&rsquo;m sure they felt uneasy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I got up and walked off, fat and happy. I walked down to the lake, then into the water. There was a boat launch made of concrete that sloped into the water. I removed my shoes and socks and soaked up to my mid calf. I had my hands behind my head and my eyes closed. The sun was so bright today. Leftover cloud space from the night before. It was deafening.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I walked along the lake on the opposite side I had tried last night. The landscape was exciting. It was like a jungle. Layers of jumping and crouching and ducking. I walked the perimeter of the lake before morning ended. She had not arrived yet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I walked out of the forest and leaned against the railing of the creek bridge. It was shaded almost to the point of it being cold. I watched the people run and play.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">A slow pan from left to right across the scene. Trees and vines. Reeds and algae. Bouncing orange, waves in water. Sand and cement.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">There.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Walked right out of the shadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We immediately departed. It was time to walk.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;We &nbsp;took the road out of the campsite, avoiding the toll booth due to the fact that it was midday. We walked dangerously along a narrow back road. Not many cars were here today. I wondered aloud if it was a weekday. Neither of us had a clue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The whole world felt like it was every color. Just intonation was ringing out across untouched barriers of sound and earth. Percussion through tree&#39;s leaves. I was happy. We smiled endlessly. The sky was an ocean of blue.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The road out to the main was long. We might not have been able to make it until nightfall if not for the kindness of the same family who fed me. They pulled up next to us from behind and demanded we ride with them into town. I told them we didn&rsquo;t know where we were going yet. The husband hanging out the right side window laughed and motioned for us to join them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The children both slept. Transitional phase for travel. The van was three layers deep. They sat in the farthest row and we jumped into the twin seats in the middle. They played music I had never heard and ran with the windows down. It was a silent ride. I watched the trees dance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">We were there in no time. They let us out at the mouth of the lake road. I had hope for them. They seemed to be good people to me. I miss good people.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">We breathed and walked in the opposite direction of the town. It was where we had been. The sun was a quarter till dark, but we kept walking and kept talking the whole while.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">She had been walking in an entirely different environment from mine. She best described her path as a swamp, however I knew there were none around here. It was watery and foggy every morning, but the sun would shine down though.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I told her about my creek and the fire. I told her about the mountain and she regretted avoiding it. I explained the story of the people who drove us to the road, and their children. It was a bathing of knowledge we did not often experience anymore.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The sun set and we considered falling off the road and into the forest for the night. We stopped and stood momentarily.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I felt such joy. Suddenly. Overflowing, overwhelming happiness that possessed my limbs completely. I picked her up and jumped into the road and ran across yellow lines that felt as significant as clouds in the sky. She yelled and my shoulder began to ache so I replaced her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Everything is waiting for me. If I knew I would understand everything. The world is holding its breath. It is all noise here. It is all here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I fell to the hard black. I laughed loudly and looked at the stars I knew so well. This was wonderful. This was everything. I heard her sit and then lay. The ground was cold actually. It was pulsing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Laying in the road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">An electric car approaches silently. He drives with his lights off to scare his fiancee. I lay too long before I hear it. She is in the other lane. Good. She will be fine. I&rsquo;ve always wondered about this. I had a dream like this once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Rising in an attempt. The light of the car flick on. I saw it swerve. My eyes darkening. I wonder if she was hit. Maybe it&#39;s better this way. Bound by forthcoming silence. I&rsquo;ve had this dream before.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">I don&#39;t remember when this turned from a story to an autobiography.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">The Greatsleep Oak</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">After sleep,</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">riddled with crevasse dreams.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">Before rising,</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">Our eyes still closed,</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">We realize.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">We&#39;re awakening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I found it in the bit of forest right near my home. I lived in a house on the edge of town. I liked to crawl on the mounds of dirt from the construction site down the road. There were trucks and bulldozers that would run up and down my street. They were making more houses. I was always scared they would tear down the trees across the street one day when I wasn&rsquo;t looking.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">It was spring when I found the tree. I was not in school. My parents kept me home because they liked to travel. I always ended my learning a bit after lunch, so I could go out and play. My mother taught me. She was a musician so I was learning to play the piano.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The weather had been warm almost every day, so my mom would let me out without a coat. It was a wet day. I decided to run in the woods instead of in the mud.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The trees were on the other side of the road. It had several holes in the bushes where deer would run through. Today, I noticed a tree had fallen over. It had fallen from inside the forest over the edge, and made a bridge into the new part of the woods I had never seen before. I climbed aboard and balanced down the tree. I ran quickly, so my neighbors would not see me and tell my parents that I was playing in the woods.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I reached the end inside the forest where the roots were torn up. From where it ended I could see the edge of a new tree line.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The Oak was at the center of a meadow filled with evergreen grass. I saw it and felt happy. I loved it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I walked slowly up to it. I was scared to be in the place. It felt important, like walking through the hallways of my father&rsquo;s work. I looked around into the forest. It was loud in the forest. The birds had come back for the summer, and animals filled the woods. The tree was so tall I should have been able to see it from my front step. It had roots sticking up out of the ground. Leaves that were the size of whale tails. An orange trunk so thick I wondered when I would reach the other side. There was a nest in the nape of the trees great neck. All I wanted was to do was curl up and dream at its feet. Forever there.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">So I ran. I was unsure, so I went home and stayed there for the rest of the day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">At dinner I sat next to the window so I could see outside. My father sat across from me and my mother next to me. My father&rsquo;s glasses reflected a glare onto my plate. It was dark outside, but I was sure I couldn&rsquo;t see the tree anywhere in the forest. I wasn&rsquo;t even sure it was that tall. I resolved to check again tomorrow. I would be ready this time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I didn&rsquo;t want to explain it to my family. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say. They would probably just tell me not to go over into the woods without parental supervision. I went off to bed not long after dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Waking quickly with a purpose. I had strange dreams.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4 c14"><span class="c2 c5">I dreamt that me and all of my friends were samurai.</span></p><p class="c4 c14"><span class="c2 c5">In the beginning we were saving townsfolk from fires and battling evil. I woke up in the middle of the night, very happy with my dream and wished nothing more than to go back and enjoy the dream for the rest of the night. When I returned, the dream had turned sour. In my absence a master better than any of us had taken control of the world and wounded one of my close friends. I resolved to be the one to put him out of his pain. With a swift slice I cut off his head. In his neck a blue sparkling water began to bubble up and out of him. It enveloped the whole world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The dream left me feeling sad. I walked downstairs ready to be done with lessons and out of the house. I ate and worked quickly. The day was sunny and dry with a bit of a breeze.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I wore jeans to prevent the thorns from grabbing me. I had thick shoes on, and my knife my father had given me on my last birthday. I walked out of the house and saw the tree sticking out of the forest.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I stepped onto the bridge tree and a gust pushed me suddenly. Totoro flying around on his top. I got back up onto the log and went into the woods.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I jumped down into the clearing and a feeling of peace replaced my adventure. Another gust shot through the land and my hair danced on my forehead. All the trees around us bent down in the wind, but the Oak stood still, and let fly one single acorn that fell to my feet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">It was an acorn from last season. I picked it up and pocketed it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I walked up to the tree and placed my hand on it. It breathed. It flowed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I sat down and looked all the way up to its enormous leaves. I layed on the ground and closed my eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4 c17"><span class="c2 c5">I step around and then kneel and lay in the grass between bushes. I feel the air moving out my nose slowing and my eyes close. The grass is still pushing up against me, but eventually through the night is will lay and rest.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;Crack and rolling noise. I spring to my feet and jump over and rip through the bushes and thorns. The night in this direction is safer than the night behind me, so I run to it. My hind legs propel me into the dark.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Breath of the air is aqueous</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The water of the last rain hanging from drooping leaves. Enough collects. The leaf breathes a sigh of relief as the droplet falls through the tree, onto me. It fell on the curve of my nose. The outer left edge. I was curled up laying on my right side. I felt nestled in the roots of my friend. I looked up the neck of the tower. A smile cracked across my lips as I stretched out my cramping muscles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The drip had awoken me. There was thigh height gold grass standing through the meadow. The grass had seeded and reminded me of wheat. It spun on the warm breeze. I had fallen asleep. It was not wet when I left. How long had I been here?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Cobwebs of haze attach to me. They are tangling themselves around me. My eyes are sinking. Till next time mid-morning grey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I should quit running already. They are probably far behind by now. They always get caught up in the hills.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">There&rsquo;s that well. It seems like I can only make it here sometimes, and other times the trees have moved around.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The well was a tube of mossed rocks. The wall seemed sturdy, and I peeked over the edge. I hoped to see the bottom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Someone behind me caught up and I backpedal to explain that I am supposed to be here.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The ground got slippery, and I slide down the entire hill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;Shock. Recovery from a mental fall. I ache. My body has outgrown my clothing. The summer is shining. I think it must be very happy with itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">My brain is rushing me to escape quickly. GET OUT! GET OUT!</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure if I even want to leave. My brain is speaking faster than my mind. Maybe I&rsquo;ve already missed too much. I surrender. It is not worth the effort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;Here we are! Just in time to meet him. I wave him over from the terminal entrance. He catches his heel on his suitcase and it jumps.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing a hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song in the airport is stuck in a loop.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three notes. Cutting. Over. and Over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;The tree has been growing around me. It is just as incredibly tall as I remember. The roots I lay in have formed a bowl. They braid themselves for me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I have stood up for the first time in decades. My back seeks the support of the tree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I walk around it, then back to the place, tracing my hand along the course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">It was such a wonderful life. I spent my existence with what I loved most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Is that the wind on the trees I hear? The sun comes through the window. The thin curtain billows quietly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">It might be mid morning, or perhaps early afternoon. The breeze is perfect and warm. I lay sprawled out on my back with my eyes closed loosely. I feel like I&rsquo;m missing someone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I could lay here for years, watching warm days turn into warm nights. It smells like the freedom of summer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">You are calling me out to play. I would love to jump up from sleep and bolt for the door and jump and roll in the grass with you, but I think I have to stay. The sun is just a bit too warm for me to move from this spot. I surely miss you, fiercely miss you. Soon enough you&#39;ll come and lay down near me. The sun will beat down on our red faces and we will laugh. Shine. I&#39;ll wait here. You would like it here. It is warm here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">goodnight, the Greatsleep Oak has caught me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Well we can&rsquo;t leave him here. I have no idea what the hell he&rsquo;s doing, but someone wake him up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried boss. Guy&rsquo;s sleeping like a rock.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;God dammit someone call the cops. He has no right to be here. Gimme your phone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so dirt was pushed over the old, unclaimed, sleeping man. He could not be removed from the hollow. Here, the secret funeral of the unnamed gentleman came to pass. The corporations at play attended in all black.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He retreated into even deeper sleep. Now he mumbles and rolls in the earth. The acorn inside the long worn pocket quivers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">The Airport Story</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;You know, Tolstoy was paid by the page. Or was it Dostoyevsky?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;No, I had never heard that.&rdquo; He must think that my reading is an indicator that I want to talk.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;My Aunt used to tell me stories about the Tropics all the time. It was well worth the trip down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Yeah, my hotel was nice.&rdquo; Jesus, he must be the kind of guy who goes on vacations alone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Were you sent on business?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c5">&ldquo;Ah </span><span class="c6 c16 c5">that</span><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;is a lucky trip. Who do you work for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s classified, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Heh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Whoa! No way! You&rsquo;re yanking my chain right?&rdquo; My god.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Nope, I&rsquo;m the real deal. Retired military, joined DARPA.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;You serve in Afghanistan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Sure. Definitely did. &nbsp;Maybe if I fall asleep he will go away.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Well that sure is cool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Mmm&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I think I will sleep while I can. My best bud has started playing games on his iPod classic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I put my books on my lap and curl up with the side of the cabin.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I wake up and the plane is shaking. The lights are jumping and there are air bags hanging in front of me. I grab my belt and unhook it. My row is empty, but there is screaming onboard. I look to my right down the aisle and take a step and the plane falls out from under me. I shudder as I am about to hit the ceiling.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I wake up and I am being poked in the leg.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Rise and shine bud! Landing turbulence!&rdquo; Freaking goodness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I am not even going to talk to him. I left my buckle clipped for the whole flight. I need the bathroom so badly. The closed sun shade is barely holding the light back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I never give in to gravitational forces in moving objects. I sit firmly in my seat as everyone leans and bumps around me. The plane smacks its front wheel on the tarmac and I can&rsquo;t wait to get up out of my sweat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">My company sent me down to the Virgin Islands for some arbitrary reason involving powerpoints. I was barely part of the team sent down to do the real work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I rise after the wait and stretch every muscle. Snatch my carry on and bolt to get out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I am first out through the sealed doors and see my ride standing outside a Starbucks. He has a woven straw hat on, and is smoking a cigarette. I cross the tile and the carpet. As I reach the flow of traffic across from the cafe I hear the dolt yelling behind me. I turn and my suitcase catches on my sandals. He is utterly bad luck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Hey! You forgot your hat!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5">It was definitely not my hat. It was a baseball cap. I hadn&rsquo;t worn one since my parents stopped dragging me to play every spring. &ldquo;Thanks there bud.&rdquo; I&#39;m not sure why I took it. I think the thought in my head was something like</span><span class="c6 c16 c5">&nbsp;my son likes sports?</span><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have a son. I think my subconscious just spitballs lies for fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">He clapped my shoulder and said something about flying again. I was already in the cafe smoking with Will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;I saw your plane fly in. I got you a coffee when I saw you sleeping against the window.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Bull. Ha ha. This coffee is dead cold dude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Yeah, happens.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I drank it. I never liked my coffee hot anyways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;We should get going. I hate crowded places.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re the boss, Will Kaber.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">The sky was crowded with fast moving clouds. It must have stormed here. I bet there are some wicked thunderstorms this time of year. He was driving a boxy dark green BMW convertible. It was hot as hell and the air was still. How could the clouds be going so fast without moving the air down here? The architecture of the wind between here and there is vastly different.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Passenger side. I put the weird hat between my legs so it wouldn&rsquo;t blow away. It was red with a faded blue patch stitched on the front. I liked it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I feel like if he knew what I was reading he wouldn&rsquo;t have spoken to me at all. My two books both took place in a surreal Japan. He would probably pin me as some weirdo that watches anime porn. Maybe the entire encounter was worth the hat. It might be my new favorite thing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Kaber&rsquo;s house was an apartment outside town a bit. It was just to the point where there started to be trees. The next day I will be back in Minneapolis. Woo. Will moved down here when he was accepted to his college, and never left. We went to highschool together. We were friends I guess. Now I have no idea what he does, but he seems like he&rsquo;s doing well here.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Hey Will, did you hear about all the Pythons they caught in the everglades? There were like hundreds of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damn shame too. Beautiful creatures.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;I guess, but they&rsquo;re wrecking the local wildlife.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Who likes local Florida wildlife anyways? Palmetto bugs and alligators.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Hah if you hate it so much why stay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Eh, I don&rsquo;t really. Just feel like complaining.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">He had a futon set up for me in the living room. He told me where the movie channels were down here and left me for the night at eight ish. I put on a Bruce Willis movie and went comatose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">A knock on my back porch door roused me in the late hours of the morning. I heard the tapping against the glass. It was probably the lawn mower. He doesn&#39;t always like to work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I went down and saw no one. My backyard was trimmed to my delight, but my pool house windows were fogged up. I was doubting my own eyes. I walked out to confirm. I&rsquo;ve never had to deal with delinquent trespassers before.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I slipped on my bathrobe and my flip flops and walked through the door, then across the wood deck, and down the five stairs to the paved path that led to the cabin-like establishment. I planned my speech and prepared my yelling voice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">In the middle of the pool house I saw the pool was filled with flipping fish. It seemed more usual than anything. I was expecting romping children. I walked around the rim of the bowl looking in with my hands behind my back. One of the fish fell out at my feet and every fish in the pool froze. They all stared at me gasping for breath.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The fish on the ground began to cry silently, and as he did, the fish in my pool took shape. Motion. They crashed through the roof of the pool house as they quickly filled the space. They began to flow everywhere.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The waves picked me up and turned me on my top. I was utterly displeased. I could breath in the mob but I did not feel as if I should, that may be cheating. Waves like undulating blankets over an unmade bed took me and crashed me against my home. I was pushed against my second story window. The glass broke and I dove face first into my bed. My eyes closed for the impact.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I took a quick nap and, upon awakening &nbsp;rose to open the shades.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The sea was shining in the afternoon light. It stood still just below my bedroom window. The silver scales looked calm while reflecting the light. It shone in every place. It was diamond.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I was sure the government was in a state of panic. I hope they do not trace the ever expanding flood to me. It was not a choice of mine that started this. All of these fish just came from my pool. My pool and I are very independent beings. They may very well decide it was my plan all along to do this, I haven&rsquo;t gone in to work in some time now. They would charge me, and my sentence would be to gather up all of the fish and dispose of them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I imagined shoveling rotting fish corpses into millions of barrels.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I resolved to flee the scene of the crime, and at that very moment my poor glass door shattered under pressure and let the fish in. They all jumped about, knocking over kitchen stools and den lamps. The lamp fell to the ground and ignited a well placed pile of wool blankets beneath it. The flood had caused a fire.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I felt the heat building as I climbed out of my bedroom window with my decided raft materials. I used a three fold laundry room door, a metal curtain rod, and also brought all the loaves of sourdough I had. When I moved my curtain to launch my boat, the fish spilled in. They spun around and under and between everything in the room. I jumped around frantically trying to avoid stepping on the innocent fish. I pushed my door out my window and jumped headlong into the passing traffic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I swam to the top of the school and clambered aboard my boat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Every direction was filled with the tumultuous action of fish in motion. The tide had risen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Far out, they built themselves up upon one another and formed great masses of wave, and they crashed down upon the landscape in their path.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I had no idea what to do at this point. A brave man might search for survivors, but I wasn&#39;t feeling up to that at the moment. I rowed for a very brief time and then stopped. If the world is entirely fish, then where was I to go? It is not exactly like a flood, I reminded myself. I could sink down to the bottom of the rumbling surface and walk along the bottom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I saw an enormous Lobster surface from the sea as if it were a submarine. It looked at me with clicking claws. It told me to look after the fish. They were going to need some taking care of shortly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">He dove beneath, red on silver.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I took out my loaf and pondered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I am going to talk to these fish.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;HELLO GREAT FISH. IN WHAT PLACE MAY I SPEAK TO HE WHO CAUSED THIS?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;go to the mountain-that is the edge of our space-the edge is where the conscious lies&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Indeed. My heading is set.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I rowed humming a tune I made up on the fly. My back was turned away from the direction I went. The sun was at full throttle beating on my skin. I had shed my white t shirt and ripped my denim jeans into shorts. I used a ripped shirt sleeve to keep my sweat up.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">Suddenly I struck land, and then again, and again as the tide undulated beneath me. I turned up to see a sheer point sticking out over the crowd of fish. On either side there were elevators ready for ascent or descent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I took the elevator to my right.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">The top of the mountain felt like an altar. It was a place to talk to gods.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I shouted out in a manly voice to the master of seas and tides. &ldquo;Oh great and mighty lord, what has happened to cause this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">I said this, and a million fish flipped at once. A breaking crack. A sea shell was shot up to the top of the rock at the bottom of my feet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Hello. I am the source of the world&rsquo;s new outfit. I hope you are enjoying the show&rdquo;, the spiral shape said to me. &ldquo;The reason for my actions are vastly irrelevant. It was a wonderful time for the sun to shine in all directions at once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;What gives you the right!&quot; -quite a malicious shell-</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Well, if you would like the flood to cease I suppose I could end it, but only if you could convince me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Yes! I will do anything!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;One condition then man. You must convince me with two words alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">What a challenge. I have been waiting for this for my entire life. &ldquo;Wind Architecture.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c5">The small shell let out a massive scream and released his grasp upon the small innocent fish. They all began to applaud before they were soon being sucked back into the pool from which they had come. Knowing my adventure was done I quickly jumped down into the slowly ebbing tide of fish and rode it home all the way to my pool house. What a nice wood finish on the floors. I hope the fish make it home safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">It smells like pancakes. &ldquo;Will, are you cooking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;You know it! World famous waffles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Hah dude thats the bomb. Need a hand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Nah I&rsquo;ll be done here in a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I peel myself out of the puddle on the red shape I slept on. I pick up whichever book is on top of my stack and open it to the page where I left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Lately I have been having such a hard time with books. I just start them and can&rsquo;t power through the end. It only happens at the very end of the book. The last hundred pages or so just bore me to death regardless of the content. To avoid this I have started reading two books at once. I probably just look more educated this way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I just thought of that while I watched half a page of words go by. Waffles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">He puts butter and syrup on his waffles. I was never patient enough for butter. He makes big round ones. I stack a couple and sit opposite of him at the wood table diagonal from my bed across from the kitchen. The main topic of conversation was waffles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">We finished up and he took both plates and put them in the sink. He leaned against the counter and gave me a sly smile. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d ya think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I suppose he wanted a review. &ldquo;The texture was really great, and the taste was probably the best I&rsquo;ve ever had. I barely needed to use the syrup.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">He smiled and nodded. &ldquo;I never forego syrup, but I&rsquo;m glad you felt that way.&rdquo; He was smiling to himself looking down into the sink as we wiped the plates under the faucet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">I didn&rsquo;t bring anything besides my books and phone charger into his house, so we could leave more easily. We were out as soon as he finished the dishes. Today he kept the top up so I put on my hat. I had left it sitting in the dash all night looking towards the window to the apartment. I didn&rsquo;t have to adjust the back for it to fit. We were made for eachother.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Back to the airport. This time I get to see the other half of the only road I&rsquo;ve even been on in Florida. We pass by a lot of failed projects on the way into the cement. One half finished structure had a tree growing through the poured stone. The cement walls had spikes of rebar sticking out of them. The tree was curving and thick. &ldquo;Will, what kind of tree is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a camphor tree.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c5">Will left with the wave of a hand. I saw a boy holding a girl crying. My departure is at eleven. I take a seat and commit to </span><span class="c6 c16 c5">number9dream</span><span class="c2 c5">. The cushion is dark green brown with a purple pattern. The man to my left is using too much of the arm rest. I feel a plane coming in to land. Sometimes the washing machine at home makes the light fixture in my bedroom shake. One night it was shaking and I saw a stink bug doing laps around the outer edge. It was just walking around it over and over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Hole</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">There is a multicolored hole in my bedroom wall. It sprouted from a leak in the bathroom adjacent. It lies behind my bed. Paper seals it. Taped down, it shall not escape. Ever since it arrived my dreams have been dissolved. Stuck in a solution. The leak pours itself into my dreams. It is thick. The hole is deep when it is covered and dark. It can go forever. Maybe a half fixed leak is the worst kind. It is small, covered, and behind my pillow. The paper cracks with motion. My pillow accumulates drywall dust. I hate it. The leak in the wall made the drywall wet, and therefore incorrect. Wetwall is insufficient. The square was removed in secret, in my absence. It was left for me to discover. I have it here somewhere. It is slowly crumbling.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It snowed more than I had ever seen. My car was buried in my garage and I was forced to call in. I sat down in the cold leather chair directly in front if the television and froze. I didn&#39;t move for an age. In my thoughts I realized I was phoneless, so I picked it from its charger on the nightstand in the other room. The sliding door in my bedroom that went out to the patio had a slope of snow against it. It would not touch the window. I checked my phone and saw an email saying my book had arrived yesterday in the mail. It was Murakami and I had been waiting for it for a heavy month. I needed it today, I would be bored. It was worth an Alaskan voyage.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The snow was fire and my choice between boots and moccasins was put to the test three steps in. I went through the yard filled with piles of ice, instead of the sidewalk that met the driveway. In an attempt to expedite my journey I ran, jumping into the white one foot at a time. My flannel pajamas were stiff on two sides from the snow. After four steps, my fifth found that the ground was lower than it had been on my last step, my grimace reacted appropriately as the ice ran up my leg. I took a delayed sixth step and found the bottom of the dust nowhere beneath me. Free falling into and through snow banks for a half second, then through black for another. My vision was in black and white. It was supremely dark, and the place from where I had fallen was flowing white.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked up and saw my long descent had really been a very long fall, or maybe I fell through a very small hole... It was a large wood board, rotted and sopping from the blankets of snow lying above it. From the entrance dust fell down to me, and I sat there frozen in a pool of wet water mixed with crystals and pebbles.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rising and knocking the snow from my pajamas. This was something I had never seen before. I was down in a well perhaps, or a retired septic tank. I would rather not consider that to be a possibility. I did not remember the wood board being there in my front yard, but it is possible to miss or disregard such things. It was too big of a space to be a well. It was a large darkness. I gave a rasping hello to test the echo (maybe I was the monster here). My voice was still recovering from the night. I wobbled around swinging limply in the darkness, kicking stones and splashing about. I found a curved wall not far away from me. This makes no sense. It seems to be a sewer, but there should be no such sewer in existence. It was enormous. I could barely touch the top of the cylinder, and I was a tall man. I had fallen through an upward section, and could not guess its height in the dark.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;I resolved to move on from my entrance, as any great explorer would. I walked forward, in the direction that would go beneath the road. It was silent besides my impolite splashing. I did not find myself worried in the slightest.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;A solid crack and crash. The tunnel shook violently to the point that the lonely pebbles began to jump in fright. A snow plow passed just above my head.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;I wandered in the darkness with my eyes squinting to find any light ahead of me. I began to question my rash course decision. I should have listened for noise, or a breeze. My fingertip touched the wall at the same time as my toe. Uninjured, but fully startled, I looked at the wall with my hands (I imagine a blind man greeting a new friend). I find a curve to my left and an opening to my right. I orient myself parallel to the new direction and walk two steps before I see a light touching the ground about a hundred steps ahead.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;An old man sat in the center of a large square drain lit by another drain above us. He smoked a long pipe and sat with his back to me. The light came down from a busy street above me. I was sweating from the heat of the sun soaking through the black asphalt.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I moved to tap his shoulder he spoke out,&rdquo; Why do you move your hand before your arm? Be careful of the waste of energy you used to take for granted. In this place you may not find yourself as spry as you once were.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was sitting in the middle of a sewer grate, turned towards myself. My legs and arms were thin and my clothes were damp and rough. I jumped and felt pain burn my leg where a pipe sat turned down. I reared my head and laughed out loud in front of myself. &ldquo;Do not fret young man&rdquo;, I said to myself, &ldquo;You will be thrown back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I stood alone looking up towards a bright sunlit square in the ceiling. I looked down and saw water pouring into the metal net below. Beware of fishermen and their nets.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;Walking in a dream. Whenever I was not in the light I was in the dark. I would see people and raw places pass, and I took it as it came, because it seemed right this way. When I could see, I found that my clothes had become brown, entirely brown. I had seen things rumbling around inside the tunnels. Big rolling hulking masses filled with yellow eyes looking through the dark. I was a spider now. Years and years of dark had entered my eyes. There is such a massive darkness here. I act as if I know this place where I wander, but I know nothing of it, I only understand the rules. I am an exception to the state of the ecosystem here in the downstairs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I once found a dome in the labyrinth. It was so tall. I heard my feet scraping against the floor when I was on the inside. There was French music playing from a small hole in the top.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I saw the man again, but this time I was prepared. I knew what he could do. I had evolved. I was once a fish, now I am a snake. Now I am a spider. He sat in a five way intersection of pipe, with the light shining down on him through a grate, and a grate below him as well. I sat in the dark to his northeast. I waited watching him for a long time. He smoked often, but always with his eyes closed. His pipe never dimmed, or ran out. I lightly considered moving to a better position, but I was sure I would never find him again, unless by happenstance.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I wondered if he found the places where the light came through. Maybe the light came though because he sat beneath it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">A monster charged above. I heard it and recognized it as my chance to catch my prey. It came over us and blocked the light for a split chance. I snaked along the wall towards him, and in the dark I saw his eyes open, and on his lips I saw a question form. I dove through him and grabbed his squirming shape. He filled my arms. He was expanding in my grip. He shifted shape.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">He became a white thousand legged octopus in the darkness, but I was not unprepared for this battle. I clung to the body of the mass as it writhed and whipped rolling through the downstairs. He shifted to a beatle too. It was jet black and cracking. It snapped at me. I held it fully and mechanically. It slowly halted and shrunk fully.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">All that was left was a gold saucer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I knew that I had to fight him. It was a part of my most basic nature. I had proved I could exist in this world of doubt. I had the key to my freedom and threw it down the grate where the old man had once sat. I did not know the world of snow or trees or literature any longer. It was not mine at all. I am a spider. I am a spider. I am a spider.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">the hole in the wall no bigger than a rectangle bits of black, red, green tape secured to the wall a stiff piece of brown paper. that stiff cover was opened when our minds saw into it. a hole in the wall. an entry to a different kind of outside. outside not like barren wind and open stars. an outside of dulled pipes, dusted switches, paled wires. frightened were our stares, we&#39;d realized what we&#39;d done. dream trappers were the contraptions, interlocking its tight cage. it looked straight at us, it had gained an entrance to our inside. protected, sealed, exposed. the paper was put back, quickly. our minds did not remember this change and reversals of the insides and outsides. the only remaining clue to the hidden outside was the brown paper, shielding us from the outside.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes the cylindrical pipes become flat on the edges. They narrow into hallways lit by green-white fluorescent lamps above. Eventually they reach a door. Usually I do not communicate with such situations, but upon trying the door at the end of one specific tunnel, I found myself in a busy metro station.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It was all grey, with men and women wearing grey suits (camouflage no doubt) all running swiftly and loudly about. They were swallowed by large running snakes filled with holes to hold customers. The snakes followed one another frequently.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">A young lady stopped and asked me if I was alright. I closed the door. She followed knocking, but I remembered enough about before to know that locks work both ways. I regressed into calm placid black.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;One night, while sitting in my web upon a pile of broken rocks, I heard once again that music that seemed to shake the tunnels with defiance. I resolved to explore after it. I was not asleep when I heard it, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever slept. I left that moment, outwards to the right in the direction of the notes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My den was at a corner of two of the larger pipes, where at some point in ancient mythology an earthquake had knocked the ceiling of the cave loose. Here in the corner the path narrowed to a slip, and it was there that I set my trap. I was a just spider, and let go those who did not yet deserve to die. I had learned my lessons from the fisherman.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Scuttling about silently in the dark I turned left and left again and found myself at the opposite end of the same dome that I had found so long ago. On this end I could see the other entrance, and I could also see a downward sloping stair in the side of the wall. The oculus of the dome was almost lit in the dark. I could see the music tumbling slowly out of it like dust. I walked along the wall towards the staircase and took it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The darkness changed slowly into a different kind of darkness. It separated from the rest of the world, that now stood above me, and became much more fluid. The world here moved, and I could see it before me. I came to a great wooden door that invited me in.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I opened It silently and saw a well lit room with a hole in the center. The brightness did not stun me as I imagined a new light would. It layed on my eyes peacefully, as if they had been waiting to see. The room was stone on all sides and had a rug upon which rested a great Piano. The walls held paintings and lamp lights intermittently. On the floor there were waist high bookcases that were serving as candle stands as well. Books were everywhere, but not in an unorganized fashion. Most were opened, but some were marked by page and shut. Before the Piano a man sat, dressed most formally, playing. The man played only the piano, but from it an orchestra resounded. It was not loud in this small room, and it took the man an almost brief &nbsp;time to observe me: somewhere between politeness and wishfulness to not have to stop.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">He turned to me and said,&rdquo; Hello my friend. I see you have grown quite accustomed to the darkness here.&rdquo; He rose and stepped over to the hole and looked down by stretching his neck over the edge, nose out front, eyes pointed down. He then looked at me with kind deep brown eyes and smiled.&rdquo; So you have become a spider here, a very wise choice. Spiders are kings of their domain.&rdquo; He walked closer to me, moved a couple of books, only to put them back in their places.&rdquo; Men change here in this level of the world. Men become anything that they find that they are... How did I know you as a spider? Well, by your eight legs of course sir!&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Indeed, it was true. Legs always tend to be a dead give away. I asked him what he found himself as.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo; Ah, I am the ocean. I am the source through which the tides have power. I sit and I play here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It seemed an appropriate time for me to leave at this point, so I flourished my formality and saluted him lightly. He laughed in a shining manner and bowed. I dropped the door and as I did the music continued right as if it had never stopped.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">While down in a well one night, watching the stars from down in the deep, I found a leafy shadow in the dark. It had many thin leaves and a broad spread of stems out from a main limb. I could not tell its color, but I wanted it. I wanted it more than anything I had ever felt. It touched me in some place lying hidden behind a rock in my subconscious. I moved up from behind the rock to glimpse it and was possessed. I took it from the well. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I planted it in a wet place above me in the space where dirt surfaced. It thrived by me and I watched it grow independently. It did not need me, but we both enjoyed the company.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Eventually it grew and spored and spread about. Strong roots snapped the concrete up and the cave slowly became a jungle, filled with trees that stretched upwards forever into black. The pebbled ground gave way to soft moss and ferns like my own. The rocks that formed my home remained, and above them grew an enormous fern. Leafy and gentle.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">On occasion I would enjoy a walk, I would wander down halls I knew very well. I would slowly expand my territory in a jolly fashion. It was a wonderful thing to be master of a plot of land. My jungle was only a small portion of the downstairs. It was a fair sized zone, although large for a spider. Outside the dark green on each side was a hallway.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">On fresh adventures I would lay out a strand of web along the floor behind me and venture until I felt that I needed to turn back. This day I decided to go further than before. I walked along walls and ceilings for an age, thinking in some place very far away. I suddenly happened upon my string. I had laid it recently. I do not remember turning. Tunnels are very crafty creatures.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I resolved to bind the two chords and retrace until I found the intersection. I turned around and walked straight back from where I had come. I often watched the floor move beneath my feet, it was calming and methodical. I began to feel like I was swimming in the French ocean.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">A smell. Quite a smell. An old smell. It smells like a green place, filled with glare and smooth walls. I turned my head over my right shoulder (chin first) and looked down a long perpendicular hallway to the one I was riding. I saw the smell coming from the arch at the end. It was cooked meat. I recognized it now. It was friendly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I made it quickly down the hall. I was worried to be disobeying my own laws by not watching my path, but I hoped this would not take long. I reached the archway and looked into a long room that moved from the corner near the arch, to the right for a very long way. It was filled with a banquet table. The table was covered with a feast, and set plates, and melted candles. The candles were still smoking, as if something had put them out in anticipation of my entrance. At the opposite end of the table I saw an enormous bowl that was the size of myself. Out of awe I ventured to it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Upon closer inspection I discovered that the bowl was a turtle. It was flipped over. It did not seem to be in distress; it looked like it had been there for a long long time. Its shell was layered by a coat of dust. I announced myself clearly in the damp light. He wobbled, like an animated egg hatching.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I backed up swiftly. I did not feel threatened in this place, but to be complacent was foolish. He jerked onto his underbelly and unfolded.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">His great head stretched upwards in greeting as he breathed a sigh of relief. He spoke in a voice that rumbles the walls and bones.&rdquo;Thank you so much my wonderful friend. I have been waiting to see you for an age. Long ago in this place I found this table and knew it would lure a man like myself to it. I have ventured from across the underworld from a place that no longer seems to be.&rdquo;. He stepped down from the table. Moss and vines dried and dead clung to his shape and turned to dust with this newfound motion. He asked me where the safety was.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I told him he could come to my forest. He was the first man I had ever met that seemed to be me. We knew that we needed to be together. He reminded me of a fern. I was sure he would love the jungle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">He was faster than one would imagine a turtle to be. He just moved, it was not unrealistic the way he went, but it was a relief to not be burdened by this friend.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">We reached the end of the arch hall and it was not as I had left it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The fern knew this was the case as we arrived. He let out an inquisitive sigh and reflected.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was feeling less like a spider and more like an ant. One small ant, far away from anything.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">He turned his head and told me to never think of fear. Fear was a great nemesis he had once defeated in this place. He thought. He possessed a cure. He motioned to the new left of the foreign hallway and I trusted him without any sign of doubt. Within seconds we arrived at the intersection of my two chords.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I had found a real thing in this cave. It was not a monster like the others. We both knew we had to stay. This was powerful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">not a turtle because the man he once was appeared as a recluse or shy fellow, that would ruin your mental image of him. he is a turtle because he contains methods. he is cognitive. he is wise. this is power here. Turtle. perhaps his environment was a flooded drain. it may have been very convenient to be a turtle. amphibious attributes are invaluable. in his shell he has been waiting. &nbsp;he waited a long while for me or one like me to come. it is impossible for there to be only a few in this place. there may be many, more than anyone could ever think of.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Our home was forested. He radiated joy in this place. He began to grow moss and trees on his back in our den. He would sleep for days. Uninterrupted silent slumber. I wondered what this sleep was like. I imagined dreams.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">He would shell himself near my rocks sometimes, and other times nowhere to be seen. I would work on without him. It was nice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I walked into the dark from the vines one day I saw something terrible. Something was terribly wrong on my course. I could not be mistaken. Something has happened.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">One of the entrances to the labyrinth was just a hole. It opened up to water. The water was a double of the darkness. It multiplied within the stagnant water. It was deep.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Out far far on the lake I saw a fish jump. It was a catfish. I saw its whiskers. It was mocking me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">On the shore of the lake there were millions of marbles. They were orange and filled with frozen bubbles. Luring.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Terror and cold. Water cold and deep. Stagnant tide without stressed winds. Tumbling. Dare not move. Beware.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">With the lake we could not leave from either exit. Our forest was surrounded by the cold dark water filled with fiery orange. We talked often. He told me many stories about where he had come from.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">His world had been swampish. He would sit and watch the alligators come and go in the dark. He was a snapping turtle then. Now he had no need for such attributes, so he rarely showed that side of himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">One story rang in my mind. He said this had happened before.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">His swamp had been made up of many degrees of land and mud and water equally, until tremors came. The rumbling made the water flow higher until only the trees remained. He had never seen the catfish. He left after the destruction of his environment. He felt it was his fault. It had followed him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">This catfish was more than one of us. If it had ever been a man at all, it had not been since the dawn of time. He controlled the shape here in the downstairs. He changed it when he pleased.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">There was no fisherman here to stop him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The water lapped against the doorway floor.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">______________________________________________________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">the hole</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">is left.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">it left.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">it will never be touched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Lodge</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">me: It sounds like the hum of tall trees under a cloudless sky.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lynn Deer: Cicadas.

They would glide alone and cold without it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lynn Deer: It is a blue hazy shield.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">me: You can see the fading edge of it. I wonder if it is getting smaller: leaking into space.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lynn Deer: Clinging blue. It is still hazy...

Be prepared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Texts seconds before sleep. Waving up and down as they shoot from phone to tower and on. My phone charger does not quite reach across my whole bed. I like to name everyone in my phone after their spirit animal. I usually text her nonsense when I run out of things to say. Sometimes it makes itself poetic. Maybe the nonsense texts come across as apathy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I read. I have a good short story collection that I am slowly eating away. I am on a story called &ldquo;The Great Case of Selective Hearing&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6">Guy Docket was a man of gestures and never used words when signals would suffice, he merely nodded when the old man addressed him after his knock. The three legged man said this upon being questioned, with long breaths and pauses.&quot;It was a good loud pop. Now, I say pop because it would have made for quite a little bang. It was a good solid pop, not sharp like a cork&quot;. It was like a synchronized group of fireworks. Pop. A very strong and robust tone, trying to be heard by the surrounding folk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is a good read in small doses. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever tried reading a mystery before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I watched my shooter jump through and around the cluster of marbles surrounded by the huddled group. Oohs, aahs, and yeses. It swung beneath a crossed leg and towards the low edge of the outdoor court. It rolled across tiny flat rocks and worn down valleys. It came to rest on a flat brown leaf. Getting up is so strenuous after sitting for so long. My Dreamsicle was a destroyer of worlds. It was my favorite shooter. Notorious on the chalk circle. I didn&rsquo;t use it often. I kept it in a bag with other good marbles. The Marbles of Destiny.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;I swung upwards and dizzily waltzed over to my shooter. It was so hot outside. I think my skin was burnt where my knees and knuckle touched the asphalt. &ldquo;I propose we take a break after this round. We could lay in the shade and enjoy the bounties of our Lord the Dollar Store.&rdquo; An eye-shaded here here resounded from the crouching group.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;I had my flip flops in my back pockets as we walked through the grass towards the shadow of the tree. I held my steaming jar of marbles in one hand, and a yellow plastic bag of assorted candies in the other. My friends around me talked ska and I proposed another get together. I had been feeling the punk lyrics flowing recently. I played guitar in a jam band now and then. Nothing serious. In fact I hate to call it anything. It was just fun.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;The park where we played was in the middle of town. It had some old tall trees in it. There was a basketball court and a Library. A creek ran through it near a swing set. There was a hill near the Library that was shaded by three trees close together. Their branches had started to bind together.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The scenery set me thinking. &ldquo;I had a dream. It may have been a memory actually. It is a true story kind of. It was from my childhood. I was with a friend of mine on a long hike in a rocky space. The trail we walked followed a river up a mountain to several waterfalls. I was thirteen or fourteen at the time. We walked ahead of our parents and siblings, and climbed up to the most remote falls near the top of the world. The first falls were for children and parents. They were for playing and splashing. After this level the ascent was more difficult. We eventually made it to the third- of I think seven falls?- and were-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait dude are you talking about White Oak?&rdquo; from behind me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah that place is the bomb.&rdquo; Still outside my peripheral vision.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Totally!&rdquo; Dan to the right.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">We all fell onto our backs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We should go to the river today.&rdquo; chimed another absently, while on the topic of water.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You guys want to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I like a good lengthy narration. It is one of my favorite things to do. Speech is a valuable asset, especially in school when the lack of effort finally catches up to you. People used to get paid for crafting sentences. Wordsmithing would be wonderful.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lynn came over and sat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can drive, I&rsquo;ve got my car here.&rdquo; I offered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stellar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Most of them didn&rsquo;t have licences out of sheer laziness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Five in my car, four in another. I drive a wonderfully large truck. It is a stick shift. I think it&rsquo;s as large as a vehicle can possibly be. Legs sticking to leather seats and classic rock stations playing. I hate rock, but I love listening to those few songs that come on the radio that are just hilariously patriotic. I always scan a specific three stations for them. Front two windows down. Hair in tatters around the cab. Everyone is in love with the breeze. The print on my shirt was sticking to my chest. I am ready for the water.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The breaking and chopping of sunlight through the riverside canopy was making me squint. I can tell there is glare coming off of the river. I can almost see it out of the corner of my eye. It&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s tickling me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The parking was everywhere along the road following the water, and we jumped in. Everyone was wearing whatever they wanted. It&rsquo;s so much easier when no one gives a fuck.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp;I can see a sea monster down the river a ways. I can hear the rocks clunking around down by my feet. I picture crabs scurrying. We all soak, and someone in the group is singing. I float wearing sunglasses in the water. I picture a camera zooming out above me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I was the second or third one out. I half dressed and laid against a tree in the shade to read. I decided I would look happy there. There was a hot breeze that dried me. My feet had a coat of dirt on them. My hair is long enough to be in a bun now. I was careful not to get the book wet, that would be a disaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6">She opened the door to the townhouse holding her unfolding robe to her chest. Black under her eyes. Taller than average. Smoking. She immediately questioned his appearance at her home, with breath that may have been the only factor keeping their home from being infested by vermin. Docket felt he may vomit. A well weathered poker face held him steady. He mentally corrected himself about the vermin. The man of the house enters the threshold and sends his wife into the background. It may be his Girlfriend. The woman in his house. He quietly says, &quot;You ruin things&quot; then he pauses.&quot;sometimes&quot;, as he gestures with his blotchy hand for her to get out of earshot. He wanted to say often. Often would have been a better word, Docket thought to himself as he bent down into his unmarked car.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lynn yelled something. Not to me. The page had been lost in the breeze of thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6">&quot;Maybe all we need is a little more self loathing&rdquo; said the suicidal girl. Suicide shot through nerves by dead drunk junkies. Leave her laying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">No. Eh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c6">&ldquo;She wanted to be deep. Six feet deep. We buried her. Six feet under the sand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11 c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Damn. Well, at least I accidently got the gist of the story.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she fell down next to me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So how does your story end?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, the one from earlier? Hah, I thought I was just monologuing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">She raises eyebrows. I can hear her saying, &ldquo;Go on?&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, we were actually really surprised when we got there. There was no one up at the third falls. The waterfall that would have led to the pool was dry. The ledge that could have been a waterfall fell into a perfectly symmetrical pool with an old log reaching into its shadows. In the pool, the ledge of the floor sloped downwards until it was about five feet deep, then it cut off like a shelf. I wasn&rsquo;t actually sure if that was just where the darkness started or if it was some strange shape. The water was totally calm though. It felt like a place of significance. We were both scared honestly, but neither of us would say it. Our fear was entirely groundless, but it was enough to make us not touch the pool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I totally understand that. It happened to me once when I was sledding. I lost a rock I was trying to keep. It fell out of my pocket into a dry spot in the middle all the snow, and I couldn&rsquo;t touch it. It was almost blue sitting there. I felt like it was a trap they had concocted for me, the snow and the ground.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah! It&rsquo;s some strange feeling that only catches you sometimes. If you were to drop the rock any other time it wouldn&rsquo;t phase you a bit.&rdquo; I paused and looked at the steady joy in the water. &ldquo;You know, they say that psychopaths are great at convincing people to do things. They can slip right through the vulnerable points in your subconscious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A weird book. There was an experiment they did where they sold cupcakes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah. Cupcakes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, and one day they sold cupcakes by saying &lsquo; Try our cupcakes! They&rsquo;re great!&rsquo;, and the second day they said &lsquo; Try our half-cakes! They&rsquo;re great!&rsquo;, and they sold way more the second day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Cupcakes and psychopaths.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yepo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">As the rest of the clan emerged from the river we all took places along the shoreline. It was a long tired day. It was less hot now, and there was a bit of a dirt beach that we could all lounge on. There was a tiny market a bit down the road. After a time, some of us went and bought a watermelon. I cut it open with a pocket knife I had in the truck and we ate it laying around my tailgate. After re-entering the river, the water grew dim, and the sun came closer to the earth.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Our group of nine was mostly good friends, with some orbiting semi-friends. There is Hal, who loves to be called that. He named himself after 2001 a Space Odyssey. It caught on. Me and Dan are good friends. He was tall like me, and we basically grew up together. He&rsquo;s a cool dude. Lynn is good friends with some guy I don&rsquo;t know. We met a bit ago at a friendly get together and I decided she was rad. There is Robin. She likes to be called Rob though, which works. Clark is dating Rob and he has really long hair. He looks majestic pretty often. We&rsquo;re all chill and none of us play sports and we all love music and we&rsquo;re all lazy bastards.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Most of us stayed by the river all night. We watched stars turn over in the sky. I might try learning them sometime. Whenever anyone tries to teach me, I always feel like I&#39;m looking through a glass cup. They point and all I see are dots. I like the idea of stars though.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Deer and I were together most of the time there, and I tried to explain the tone of the short story without a plot deluge. I called it sad. Not sad like a violin, sad like a bass drum alone on stage. I couldn&rsquo;t feel the sadness then. There was this long breath of happiness around me. I could feel the sadness at home. I can feel it when the wind rattles my room. My dad always wakes me up when he slams the door on his way out. Sometimes I forget about everything. Sometimes it catches up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am a taxi driver. Everyone home. Blegh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I got to sleep on the bench seat in the front, which was wonderful.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am glad the weather is finally warm enough to swim again. Winter is utterly defeating.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yesterday&rsquo;s sweat is making my stomach stick to itself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I watch myself roll through the door and up the stairs into my room. My bed&rsquo;s waitress is named Exhaustion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is bright outside. Official guess is 2:43.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Oh, noon and a half. What a pleasant surprise. Phone says three messages from Lynn Deer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lynn Deer: I forgot my sunglasses in your truck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lynn Deer: We should go to that bookstore today. The used one where you got your book.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lynn Deer: What was that show you told me about? Cooper and something about mountains?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ah, wonderful. In reverse order-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c20"><span class="c2">me: Twin Peaks. Entirely marvelous. Yeah I could go for books. When is good? I will check for the sunglasses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The word rummage is a good word. It is exactly what I&rsquo;m doing. I&rsquo;m throwing everything because nothing is important. Rummage rummage rummage. Negative on the sunglasses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lynn Deer : I&rsquo;m good whenever.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">me: No luck with the glasses. How about now? I&rsquo;m not doing anything.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lynn Deer: Wonderful</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">She lives almost exactly a mile away from my house. I&rsquo;ve counted it on the tachometer. She is ready at the door when I drive up. &ldquo;Hey there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, so where are we going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just down 50 a ways.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t usually drive with the radio on with one other person in the car, unless we are djing. I plug the strange cylinder shape into the cigarette lighter and ask her to put on music.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Why are you looking grave?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Are you thinking of something to say?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Why are you sitting there?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Are you hoping that someone will stare?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Your mouth is hiding,</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">You&#39;ve got smiling eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Hah, she knows I like this song. &ldquo;So this bookstore is totally great. It has really nice quality, and it doesn&rsquo;t reek of cat piss like that other one. I&rsquo;ve bought several good books there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh huh, do you have anything you&rsquo;re looking for specifically?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, I always watch for Mitchell and Murakami, but today I&rsquo;m looking for anything by Italo Calvino. I&rsquo;d really like to find his short stories book.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yikes, you&rsquo;re a surreal mastermind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Rolling up the manual windows and slamming car doors. Greet the guy at the counter. I wonder if he has started to recognize me yet. There is a real cash register sitting on the glass counter. Books organized in various order.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is a lot of books.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Yep, utterly fantastic.&rdquo; </span><span class="c6 c16">Into The Wild </span><span class="c2">is sitting on a featured book shelf. &rdquo;Do you have that one?&rdquo; The copy looked like it had been into the wild.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whaaaat? How? You talk about running away all the time! This is like the epitome of escape. You should buy it. It&rsquo;s marvelous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Three dollars for a lifestyle change is such a great deal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I bought this during the summer. I feel like it&rsquo;s one of those read-in-a-day books.&rdquo; she said as she jumped into the truck.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to loan it to me. I barely remember it. We can watch the movie too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Truck starts. Fade into third gear right off the bat. Heck yes. &ldquo;So, Twin Peaks. It is a mystery story about a murdered girl, but to just call it that would be crazy. The reason I love it is for the surrealism. The antagonist is also the absolute best ever. He is the definition of evil itself. We should also watch that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Twin Peaks. When did it come out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ages ago. 1990 I think. It&rsquo;s on Netflix.&rdquo; I take a tight turn and the gravity shifts. The truck sits pretty high off the ground. I can feel it tilting. City driving is hazardous. The music fills the comfortable pauses through car rides as we move from city to suburb to farmland. I watch the trees move above me as I drive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Hey Lynn, would you like to go to the arboretum today? We could sit and read our newly acquired books.&rdquo; I had bought a book of Haikus</span><span class="c6 c11">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That actually sounds great.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Choppy sentences laying in the grass. Almost every poem has an explicit seasonal setting. The trees are bred to look cool here. They are mixed up. Willows, maples, and pines all in one. I think that time doesn&rsquo;t move at all, we move through time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">We enter the highway again. I think driving is incredibly peaceful.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">&ldquo;This book is perfect. Why can&rsquo;t this be the way things are.&rdquo; Still reading </span><span class="c6 c16">Into The Wild</span><span class="c2">. &rdquo;Let&rsquo;s just run.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all run away.

What is there left to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s buy a shack in the woods and grow plants indoors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Walk and walk until we sleep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The road makes noise when you drive on it. The tires roll like a drum. I love full trees and birds. I like watching the world go when other people are driving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Waving goodbye through the glass door. I am happy. The sun is setting. I guess I will go home.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">me: Let&rsquo;s run away. I&rsquo;ll spread the word. We can collect all the people who don&rsquo;t want to be humans anymore and bring them along. It would be a mass exodus into the woods. Into The Wild.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lynn Deer: There&#39;s a city. On the top of the mountains. And there&#39;s a forgotten forest there, full of those drunken trees.

I only dog ear a page that I may want to return to someday, a page I really like. I hate the inconsistency of dog ears sometimes though. Is it better for folds in a book to be close to the same depth on the page but not, or to be skewed apart as if it really didn&#39;t mean anything?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The last pages of Selective Hearing paint Dockett digging in the sand on a raining beach after a long and arduous case.

He hasn&rsquo;t grown out of wearing all black yet, how cute. &ldquo;Hey, so what&rsquo;s the big surprise?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We are planning a car trip, and we were wondering if you all would like to join us!&rdquo; Mr. Deer is a single parent.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Holy goodness, I am so doing that. When is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really short notice, but like this week. We want to leave early Thursday. Dad&rsquo;s got a business something in Minnesota and there are some awesome lakes there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yes. A roadtrip to ease this runaway slump sounds wonderful. I feel strange. Maybe this is what being giddy is like. I turn around smiling and the front door is still open. The mesh screen is concaving in and out. I think I&rsquo;ll go yell outside with this happiness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go celebrate on the porch momentarily.&rdquo; I say to the door down the hallway. My feet are floating. I&rsquo;m not sure this is happiness at all. It&rsquo;s so overarching. I have so much time to describe this feeling. I&rsquo;m at the door now. I blink when my hand makes contact with the black metal handle of the white porch door. I can see stars behind my eyes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I step out the door and my toes curl over my flip flops, dipping into the crunching snow pack. There was frost forming on my bare skin and I could hear my eyes drying out. I step back through the door and fall down a step onto a wooden floor. My eyes are flashing and my tailbone hurts. The door was swinging open and I was sitting in front of a man eating oatmeal to my left. I look at him momentarily out of the corner of my eye. He had it all in his beard. I can see tall thin trees outside through the doorway, they are white like the sky. I am severely cold. It was not white outside. It was raining actually. I stood facing a divided highway in the drizzle. There is a stationary mobile home behind me and a very ugly woman sitting on a metal swing to my right. I run and jump, tripping over the metal fence. I slide around in the &nbsp;grass. I twisted my ankle, but I never really understood how people thought that was any reason to stop in an emergency. Maybe I don&rsquo;t understand what twisting an ankle is. My hair is all over my face. It is not wet enough to stay back yet. The rain is coming down hard now. It&#39;s a warm Summer rain. There is something happening to me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am not where I was. This is obviously what some deity though I meant by running away. &ldquo;He must have some sort of misplaced desire to travel.&rdquo; Fuck. Well. I can be positive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The old lady is yelling at me in a different language. Maybe it&rsquo;s just a severe accent. I don&rsquo;t like this spot. I am going to go through the door again. I want to see what will happen. She is waving her arms now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s warm here. Thank goodness. I am in a sunny place. The landscape does not look like America. I am willing to bet it is Europe. Italy maybe. There was a school trip to Italy last year. I always wanted to go. There is a man on a horse. This is the past. I am so excited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The peace of loss settled on me quickly. I had always been a realist. I knew I would never see them again and that is alright I guess. I think I still age, although it is hard to tell. I can never decide if I should stay in the same place, or keep moving around, so I move around. I haven&rsquo;t been to Japan yet. I&rsquo;m looking forward to that. Windows show me the next destination beforehand. Thresholds are gateways through time and space. I&rsquo;m not even sure what I look like anymore. I wonder if somewhere there are stories about me. Myths. Thresholds are so wonderfully symbolic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My dreams have become prophetic. Sometimes I dream of where I will go next. I have one that shows my death I think. A puddle of clear water. From it leak hundreds and hundreds of roots. The puddle is as black as the night above. It is a perfect reflection. The water was moving like lips trying to form words. &ldquo;Jump in&rdquo; the shade around me says. Ghost hands sneaking into my palms.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Wake up.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t get worried so often about it. I&rsquo;ve always been apathetic towards my future.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I like to zip around sometimes. I can move pretty quickly, but unfortunately I have to go entirely through the door for me to move. When I just stick my head in and look around I see nightmares. I see a fictionalization of myself looking back at me with black eyes. He leans towards me through the doorway smiling. It is unpleasant.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am currently sleeping on the couch of a house in what sounds like a city. I am not sure who lives here. It is interesting how if I wanted to stay somewhere forever I would have to either stay inside or outside for the rest of my life. I sometimes dream of school or work. Outside I see rainy green hills. Maybe it is Ireland. It will be a good adventure tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am walking the green rain. My eyes are squinting. I took a coat from my previous flatmate. I aim to reach the top of the hill. Everything is hills. Rounded green hills for miles and miles. I reach the crest and sit down cross legged in the wet. I can hear a highway around me. If I close my eyes I can see cars passing through me. I feel the rain on my face. I smell the wet material of the unfamiliar coat. I am transcending. Maybe this is what all those Buddhists are looking for.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I came from an abandoned stone shack. I sit outside it for a while and bathe in the rain. I can&rsquo;t see where I&rsquo;m going next. The walls of the building are made of round stones. Time is absolutely nothing. I move from day to night daily. I wonder how long I&rsquo;ve been doing this. I can remember a few places. Maybe it&rsquo;s only been minutes since I left Lynn Deer sitting at the dining room table.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I take the air from what I&rsquo;m calling Ireland and bring it to my next house. The cold air is breathed out against a smoking man&rsquo;s stream of nicotine. Backing out of the room. I wonder if he even saw me. He might think I&rsquo;m a passing breeze. The air is shocking. I feel such a beautiful breeze. My body has become tuned for nature, and I feel something here. I turn towards a field of blossoms on drooping trees.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The world is moving. I only see white and pink. My hands seek the rail in front of me as I approach the edge of a wooden porch. I am on a building. It is wood and beautiful. I wonder if this is some sort of shrine. I want to stay here forever. This is where I will stay. I think a lack of explanation here tells more words than I could ever summon. It is so old. The air is full of ancient feeling. I will call this Japan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&quot;Can you see the lights? They&rsquo;re like infinitely pointed stars, with spears shooting out in two opposite directions. It&#39;s always been there. I&#39;ve seen them for as long as I can remember.&rdquo; an old man dressed in faded blue came up to me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can see them too.&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I think I&rsquo;m glad I never learned them. When they are nameless the sky is all one thing. I feel like if they were separate it would take away from the overall feeling. I wasn&#39;t talking to him specifically. I was speaking out over the same balcony I had come from, back in another age. I was talking to the trees and the breeze. I scarcely wore a thing. My dark hair was back and I stood with my eyes closed and my hands out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have been here for a time. I think this time period is the past in relation to my birth, but I cannot tell. I noticed I have never gone to the future, only the past. Maybe that is part of the deal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I sit on this end of the building every day. Sometimes I sleep here against the wall of the temple. Maybe people think I am making a pilgrimage. I am here to enjoy my life, not to be an anything. This doesn&rsquo;t feel like what I imagined being here would feel like. It is full of feeling. I imagined it flowing, but it is more like falling through excitement. I am so glad I am just allowed to exist here. There is a little shack against a bamboo wood close to here that is perfect. I sleep there sometimes, just laying on the ground. One morning I found a snake coiled in the curve of my body. Everything here encourages life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Maybe that girl Lynn was a spirit, and she granted me my greatest wish. I did make a heavy argument towards running away. I think I am happy with the way this all turned out. Maybe Lynn was God. Maybe she saved me from my certain death on that porch somehow. Maybe if a will is truly strong enough, it will surmount that physical world. I might be dreaming. This could be an afterlife, a Purgatory where I will sort out my sins. It is easiest not to think really.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I do not usually explore, today I think I will. It is oddly unsatisfying to be sitting and watching the breeze. I collect my clothes and put on my flip flops. I bring a sack with my jeans and flannel shirt. There is a forest all around the entire temple. I walk right on through.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a person anymore. I have a different set of rules than the rest of humanity. I think my personality has changed entirely. I&rsquo;ve gone quite flat. Friends seem to define personalities.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I see camphor trees. Clumps of bark in the bamboo web. I wander towards them on soft feet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Ghost hands sneaking into my palms. They are holding me and hurrying me along. I smile at them and run with them. The sticks and points blur and I see only green.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">An entrance in an old part of the forest. It is a wooden gateway. The trees part and the inside is dark. There are picked plants laying all around the entrance on flat round stones. Offerings to the spirits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Inside, there sits a puddle of clear water. It has a single pink petal floating. From it leak hundreds and hundreds of netted roots. The puddle is as black as the canopy world above. It is a perfect reflection. It was moving like lips trying to form words. Jump in the motion around me says as they gently usher me towards the circle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I see Deer. I see her there. My God. I&rsquo;m on the steps of her front porch. She is running upstairs. There are bags in the front room.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is a door. I&rsquo;ve never seen my reflection before. I haven&rsquo;t changed. The fox faced spirit comes up to me with a voice. It tells me it is there, but they saved me for a reason. They brought me here. Things happen for reasons.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve always had this non-religious belief in fate. I think I have to go back. Don&rsquo;t think about it. I&rsquo;ve never been one to second guess myself. The pool is just large enough for me to fit inside.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Nothing. A flash of headlights on a window pane. I am falling. We are liars. Humans are liars. Death and insanity and old age to look forward to. Life is but a black cage that covers those within, who are born white as snow, in an ash. The ash cakes onto their soul and skin until they rot and become the ash and grime for the next soul to enter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am sitting in a misty mountain lake, up to my nose in the clearest water. There are rock walls in front of me and a beach of rounded stones behind. The rock walls have trees floating up out of them and green moss. I walk backwards up onto the beach.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am in a hexagonal room. All the walls are mirrors. I step forward out of the invisible doorway. I see myself with deep black eyes. I walk through and into the mirror directly in front of me. It is not like walking through water, it&#39;s exactly like you would imagine walking through solids would be like. It is grainy. Like the sand glass comes from. I am in a darkness. No, my eyes are closed. I feel the brush of air on my farthest extension. I freeze for a moment. It is dancing around my fingers. I can see it spinning in my mind.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My hand is holding the door open for Lynn as she crosses the threshold out of her house.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey! Wasn&rsquo;t sure if you were going to make it!&rdquo; I remember this face.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is life I think. The morning is dark. I hear crickets actually. This is life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where are your bags?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go get them from my house, sorry. Is that alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nah, shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I walk down the steps of her porch after her. The green station wagon is sitting by the curb. I am on the second to last step and look up. The stars and morning are trading off. These stars look no different than the rest of them. I am breathing again.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bright lights. The night is burnt off instantly. I understand. My god. My god. They tried to save me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Design</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am born here into hands. I am now aware. I was spun into existence by this white void around me. I was algae on the surface of a glass, he spun me around his finger, and now I am.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Come now boy. Build a forest. It will be yours to hold. Shape its animals and trees by your own design. Let the rocks hum with your creativity. Nothing will hold you back. Go out and graph the land. My earth is clay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Yes, I think It will be green.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I pinched the surface of the ground and pulled a tall tree from it. I rolled my cupped hand overtop and gave it the canopy. I placed my palms flat on the surface of the ground and grass and saplings awoke between my fingers. I could feel them pushing up beneath my hands too. I looked up and out and the world shook and turned. The trees folded up from underneath the surface of my land. I scooped the dirt in one part of my world and swirled water into the hole I had made. It would worship the sky above for all of time. I looked out and saw that everything was flat and I felt that there was too much in front of me for me to continue. I had nowhere to begin. Would I just make trees forever?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I saw my father watching me from above. I had to think of something to impress him. I resolved.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I put both of my hands deep into the soil and pulled it upwards. I ripped and pushed the landscape together to create a crease. It was rocked and brown and ugly. At the base where the green remained I grew trees, and on higher I bred a new tree. It lived in the new conditions I created. I saw my father above laughing and smiling. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I drew my finger between the holes I had filled to make moving rivers. Some were deep and roaring while others fell silently between my trees.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My father turned our world and the lamps faded and I laid to rest at the center of my creation, beneath my tree.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I awoke from sleep in utter quiet. I decided that there must be sound in this world of mine. I made animals to sing in the trees. I gave them the ability to hear and be heard, and they evolved to sing. They could float on the air from place to place. I walked among the trees and enjoyed my world. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Days went by and the plants became rowdy in their adolescence. They grew up and between the trees. They had become too high for me to walk between them. I needed something to keep the plants low, so I made new animals to live along my birds. I understand balance now. There will be tiny crawling ones to eat small plants, and small jumping and running ones to eat larger plants. Beetles and ants and deer and moles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I will make animals to eat the animals. Flying and running killers. Wolves and Hawks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I saw my first creation killed by another of my creations and I cried. These animals will keep each other stable. Death is the beginning of life here. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can walk through the woods with my animals if I choose. I can also walk as I am. Being a bird is my favorite. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c7 c9 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I woke up again today with a foreign sense. There was something in my forest that was not made by my hand. I jumped through the trees towards a small spring at the edge of my kingdom.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I watched it move. It was shaped like me. There are more of us, I know this, but this one seems senseless. It blunders through my creation blindly. I feel my father coming down next to me in the form of an owl. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes my son, this is a new creation. It was made by an old spirit of a faraway forest. He made it in spite of me. He was my oldest, most beloved, and cherished son. He created in his own image a being to worship him, and here it stands.&rdquo; The being was mixing the water and dirt.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is strange. I do not hate it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is wise my son. It is not evil, only its creator has gone sour.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My father flew off and I sat and watched the human. I sat on a perched branch in a tree. It was helpless. I feared for its life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">As night came my wolves found this ugly thing in the dark. They had no respect for it, and wished to test its strength. They tore him apart in his sleep. I do not think he was meant to live. This simple creature cannot best my animals bred for such singular purposes. Maybe if I see one again I will shield it and watch it. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My father told me more about the sour spirit. Its creation grew and devoured him. The humans he made would leave his domain in search of the world, or stay and build. They stacked his trees to hide from the wilderness, and ate his animals. They cut deep into the forest in search of ever more wood. They found his heart black and wilted. The spirit lashed out with an effort against his creation. He poisoned them all with envy and hate. His creation fell in upon itself and the domain of the spirit became lifeless. My father says that the spirit withered to nothing, but still stirs in that unholy place. He flattened the land and scorched it. It now rolls like a slow ocean.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I fly with the birds to the edge of my land. The weather is turning cold, and my trees are dying. I can see them pushing their life down into their roots. The animals are all digging into the earth and falling asleep. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">A day came when the sky fell in white bits and powdered the land. I saw some animals jumping and playing in it. I sat as a bird on my tree in the cold. I watched as this time passed. There was nothing for me to maintain here. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I speak to my father less and less. He is raising me towards independence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I saw a human in the snow one day. I watched him walk with the skin of an animal on his back. I would save this one if I could. I swooped down and flew around him as a crow. He looked up at me and ran into my wood with fright. He was tripping and falling in the snow. I made a hill and hollowed the inside. I formed the wood into a chute and led him into the hole.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">He became my sole interest in the winter months. I watched him. I would become a lizard and slip into his house. He was methodical. He was not ruining or destroying anything. All of these creatures are not simple. I watch the man create things. He was imbued with the gift of the spirit who made him. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The Winter melted and the man came out of his hole just like the animals. He would sit in the sun for hours and hours. He swam in my lakes. He was methodical. This is interesting. I may meet him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man was sitting holding berries he had found in the shade. I showed myself to him as I was. He acknowledged me and stared for a time. He rose and offered his berries to me.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man brought berries to my tree for his entire life. I noticed on his last day that the berry had not come, so I went to the hole and found him lying peacefully on his back in front of his home. I saw no life in him and I understood his passing. He had been with me for years and years. I would miss him. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I sat cross legged near him for a while and looked up at the canopy. His last sight was filled with absolute light. Light green fading to yellow in the leaves, absolute untouchable blue. There is a breeze that smells sweet. He must have loved his last seconds. I&rsquo;m sure he lived such a life. He will be surely missed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">As I moved to get up, a spraying rain doused me. I felt the water moving along my face and body. The air had no temperature. I was absolutely wet, and I felt the sadness leave my body. Death is gone in the ran.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I can spend weeks at a time as a bug. I love the direction of it. Life is entirely purpose driven and direct. I eat out rotten wood and climb slowly up trees. I chew a leaf for days. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Humans seem to be growing. I can see them now and again at the edge of my thoughts. They are living together. They take wood from my forest, but I am more than capable of managing it. I feel that compassion towards humans should be my course of action.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">One day they developed themselves inside my land. There is a large group of them living here. I think I am glad they are here. It is something new.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Out in my green meadow there is a small wooden spike sticking out of the ground. Two came and placed it there once. It has faded words on it. I think it marks a grave. It is beautiful place. They come back to visit now and again. Sometimes I sit on a branch and watch them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">They buried a clump of rubber. When they visit they leave strange things like metal wire and small lost white balls. They are quite different than the rest of the town. They remind me of bugs.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c15"><span class="c2">I don&rsquo;t mind roads and trash as much as one would probably think. If I didn&rsquo;t want people here I would stop them at the border. There are other spirits not so kind. I like to grow my grass up through the wrought iron gates and torn tin cans. I like to take the you, and cover it in me. I like to have trees grow right on top of forgotten hunting shacks, until the trees get so large that the ruins collapse and my rains turn the structure to dirt. I wear down the yellow on the drives and crumble the edges. It is all in good fun you know, I am not being malicious. I am just playing back. The Earth is cyclical.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">One night I heard a car in the rain. I looked and saw the boy from the grave. I followed him to my river and watched him get out in the dark. He left his window open. I crept into the car as a beetle. He took water from the river and got back in his car. As he drove off he noticed me in his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Hello sir. I&#39;d like to take the time to say a few words before you do whatever you intend to. May I first preface myself by saying that I know you most definitely have more of a reason to kill me than I have a reason to live. That may very well be true, so I will not argue or plead for my life in any manner. I just feel the need to eulogize myself. I can almost see you there sitting behind me. A handgun barely touching the soft padding behind my seat. A pike poised and ready to be stabbed through me at a moments notice. I&#39;m not sure of your intentions or forms, but you must know something I don&#39;t here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Well after some time I am not yet dead, and this long silence is drowning me, I hope you don&#39;t mind if I sing a song. It is a song from my childhood. I know what you would say, I am still a child, but in reality I am eighteen. This song is old to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He spoke words I did not understand. He sang like a bird. It was beautiful. He fell silent again and drove on towards the edge of the wood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I wonder sir if you are really there behind me. Your stoicism is terrifying. I&#39;m sure if I were to see your face you would surely end me. I dare not turn. This reminds me of a dream. Have you ever read The Fall by Camus? I find it to be a wonderful read. You would probably love it. I can see lights from the road on the other side of the river. This road is filled with potholes. Make sure you don&rsquo;t lose your grip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I believe that you cannot be in this seat behind me. It is impossible. I can see the lights from the highway now. They are bringing back my rational thinking. Even if you are sitting there, ready to kill me through some devious method, if I find that I am sure you are not real, you will not be. Goodbye and goodnight sir. It was wonderful chatting with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I faded out of the car with his final words. He immediately considered me hostile upon my entry. I suppose I may have been intruding. I am surprised he noticed me there. He may be different than the rest. He reminds me of the first one I met so long ago. He has an ear for nature.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">-</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I have not seen my father since the first man. Maybe the loss of a child destroyed him. I feel lonely from time to time. I cling through the white snow fog as an owl on the topmost branch. Silence and thought.

They made little stone houses and placed them against my tree. Houses for spirits no doubt. Worship is not what I seek anymore. I want to be loved, not respected. The two humans love me, I know it. They do not know my form, if they did they would surely embrace me.
